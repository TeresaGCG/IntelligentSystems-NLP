b. If :l system uses odd pa rity, and the word 010 1 appears on the processor 
memory bus, we suspect that a single-bit error has occurred. Can we tell
which bit the error occurs in? \-Vhy or why not?
c. If a system uses even parity and the word 010 1 appears on the processor-
memory bus, can we tell if there is a double-bit error?
8.16 (10 ) <§8.3> A program repeatedly performs a three-step process: It reads in
a 4 KB block of data from disk, does some processing on that data, and then writes
out the result as another 4 KB block elsewhere on the disk. Each block is contiguous
and randomly located on a single track on the disk. The disk drive rotates at 10,000
RPM, has an average seek time of8 ms, and has a transfer rate of 50 MB/sec. The
controller overhead is 2 m s. No other program is using the disk or processor, and
there is no overlapping of disk operation with processing. The processing step
takes 20 million clock cycles, and the clock rate is 5 GHz. What is the overall speed
of the system in blocks processed per second?
8.17 [5] <§8.4> The OSI network protocol is a hierarchy of layers of abstraction,
creating an interface between network applications and the physical wires. This is
similar to the levels of abstraction used in the ISA interface between software and
hardware. Name three adva ntages to using abstraction in network p rotocol design.
8.18 [5] <§§8.3, 8.5> Suppose we have a system with the following characteris 
tics:
I. A memory and bus system supporting block access of 4 to 16 32-bit words.
2. A 64-bit synch ronous bus clocked at 200 MHz, with each 64-bit transfer
taking 1 clock cycle, and 1 clock cycle required to send an address to mem  
ory.
3. Two clock cycles needed between each bus operation. (Assume the bus is
idle befo re an access.)
4. A memory access time for the first four words of 200 ns; each additional set
of four words can be read in 20 ns.
Assume that the bus and mem ory systems described above are used to handle disk
accesses from disks like the one described in the example on page 570. If the I/O is
allowed to consume 100% of the bus and memory bandwidth, what is the maxi 
mum number of simultaneous disk transfers that can be sustained for the two
block sizes?
8.19 [5] <§8.5> In the system described in Exercise 8.18, the memory system
took 200 ns to read the first four words, and each additional four words required
20 ns. Assuming that the memory system takes 150 ns to read the first four words
and 30 ns to read each additional four words, find the sustained bandwidth and the
latency for a read of 256 words for transfers that use 4-word blocks and for trans-
