8.8 Real Stuff: A Digital Camera 605
The CompactFlash standard package was proposed by Sa ndisk Corporation in
1994 for the PCMCIA-ATA cards of portable PCs. Because it follows the ATA
interface, it simulates a disk interface including seek commands, logical tracks,
and so on. It includes a built-in controller to support many types of Flash memory
and to help with chip yield for Flash memories by mapping out bad blocks.
The electronic brain of this camera is an embedded computer with several spe 
cial functions embedded on the chip. Figure 8. 16 shows the block diagram of a
chip similar to the one in the camera. Such chips have been called systems on a
chip (SOC) because they essentially integrate into a single chip all the parts that
were found on a small printed circuit board of the past. SOC generally reduces
size and lowers power compared to less integrated solutions. The manufacturer
claims the SOC enables the camera to operate on half the number of batteries and
to offer a smaller form factor than competitors' cameras.

FtGURE 8.16 The system on a chip (SOC) found In Sanyo digital cameras. This block dia 
gram is for the predecessor of the SOC in the camera in Figure 8.14. The successor SOC, called Super
Advanced IC, uses three buses instead oftwo, operates at 60 MHz, consumes 800 mW, and fits 3.IM transis 
tors in a 10.2 x 10.2 mm die using a 0.35-micron process. Note that this embedded system has twice as
manytransistors as the state-of-the-art, high-performance microprocessor in 1990! The SOC in the figure is
limited to processing 1024 x 768 pixels, but its su((;essor supports 1360 x 1024 pixels. (See Okada, M.11suda,
Yamada, and Kobayashi [19991).
