8.4 [ IOJ <§§8.1-8.2> Consider the laptop's hard disk power consumption in
Exercise 8.3. Assume that it is no longer constant, but varies between 6 watts when
it is spinning and 1watt when it is not spinning. The power consumed by the lap 
top apart from the hard disk and wireless ca rd is a constant 32 watts. Suppose that
the hard disk's transfer rate is 50 MB/sec, its delay before it can begin transfer is 20
ms, and at all other times it does not spin. How many complete files can we transfer
before the laptop's battery runs down to zero? How much energy would we need
to send all 100 files? (Consider that the wireless card cannot send data until it is in
memory.)
8.5 [5J <§8.3> The following simplified diagram shows two potential ways of
numbering the sectors of data on a disk (only two tracks are shown and each track
has eight sectors). Assuming that typical reads are contiguous (e.g., all 16 sectors
are read in order), which way of numbering the sectors will be likely to result in
high er performance? Why?

8.6 [20J <§8.3> In this exercise, we will run a program to evaluate the behavior of
a disk drive. Disk sectors are addressed sequentially within a track, tracks sequen 
tially within cylinders, and cylinders sequentially within the disk. Determining
head switch time and cylinder switch time is difficult because of rotational effects.
Even determining platter count, sectors/track, and rotational delay is difficult
based on observation of typical disk workloads.
The key is to facto r out disk rotational effects by making consecutive seeks to indi 
vidual sectors with addresses that differ by a linea rly increasing amount starting
with 0, 1, 2, and so forth. The Skippy algorithm, from work by Nisha Talagala and
