FIGURE 2.5 The hexadeclmal-blnary conversion table. Just replace one hexadecimal digit by the corresponding four binary
digits, and vice versa. Ifthe length of the binary number is not a multiple of4, go from right to left.
hexadecimal Numbers in verts easily into binary. Since almost all computer data sizes are multiples of 4, hexa 
base 16. decimal (base 16) numbers are popular. Since base 16 is a powerof2, we can trivially
convert by replacing each group of four binary digits by a single hexadecimal digit,
and vice versa. Figure 2.5 converts hexadecimal to binary, and vice versa.
Because we frequently deal with different number bases, to avoid confusion we
will subscript decimal numbers with tefl, binary numbers with two, and hexadeci 
mal numbers with hex. (If there is no subscript, the default is base 10.) By the way,
C and Java use the notation Oxnnnn for hexadecimal numbers.

EXAMPLE Convert the following hexadecimal and binary numbers into the other base:
eca8 6420
hex
0001 0011 0101 0111 1001 1011 1101 1111 two
Just a table lookup one way:
ANSWER
eca8
1110 1100 1010 1000 0110 0100 0 10 OOOOtwo
And then the other d irection too:
0001 0011 0101 0111 1001 1011 1101 11l1
