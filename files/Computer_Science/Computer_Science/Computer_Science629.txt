The basic algorithm skips through the disk, increasing the distance of the seek by
one sector before every write, and outputs the distance and time for each write.
The raw device interface is used to avoid file system optimizations. SI NGL E_
SECTOR is the size of a single sector in bytes. The SEE K_CU Rargument to 1see k
moves the file pointer an amount relative to the current pointer. A technical
report describing Skippy and two other disk drive benchmarks (run in seconds or
minutes rather than hours or days) is at http://sunsite.berkeley.edli/DienstIUI/2.01

Run the Skippy algorithm on a disk drive of your choosing.
a. What is the number of heads?
b. The number of platters?
c. What is the rotational latency?
d. What is the head switch time (the time to switch the head that is reading
from one disk surface to another without moving the arm; that is, in the
same cylinder)?
e. What is the cylinder switch time? (It is the time to move the arm to the next
sequential cylinder.)
