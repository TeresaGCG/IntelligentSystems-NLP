For higher performance, it has two buses. The 16-bit bus is for the many slower
I/O devices: Smart Media interface, program and data memory, and DMA. The
32-bit bus is for the SDRAM, the signal processor (which is connected to the
CeO), the Motion IPEG encoder, and the NTSC/PAL encoder (which is con 
nected to the LCD). Unlike desktop microprocessors, note the large variety of I/O
buses that this chip must integrate. The 32-bit RIse MPU is a proprietary design
and runs at 28.8 MHz, the same clock rate as the buses. This 700 mW chip con 
tains 1.8M transistors in a 10.5 X 10.5 mm die implemented using a O.35-micron
process.
Fallacies and Pitfalls
Fallacy: The rated mean time to failure ofdisks is 1,200,000 hours or almost 140
years, disks practically neverfail.

The current marketing practices of disk manufacturers can mislead users. How is
such an MTTF calculated? Early in the process manufacturers will put thousands
of disks in a room, run them for a few months, and count the number that fail.
They compute MTIF as the total number of hours that the disks were cumula 
tively up divided by the number that failed.
One problem is that this number far exceeds the lifetime of a disk, which is
commonly assumed to be five years or 43,800 hours. For this large MTTF to make
some sense, disk manufacturers argue that the calculation corresponds to a user
who buys a disk, and then keeps replacing the disk every five years-the planned
lifetime of the disk. The claim is that if many customers (and their great 
grandchildren) did this for the next century, on average they would replace a disk
27 times before a failure, or about 140 years.
A more useful measure would be percentage of disks that fail. Assume 1000
disks with a 1,200,000-hour MTTF and that the disks are used 24 hours a day. If
you replaced failed disks with a new one having the same reliability characteristics,
the number that would fail over five years (43,800 hours) is
Failed disks = 1000 drives X43.800 hours/drive = 36
1,200,000 hours/failure
Stated alternatively, 3.6% would fail over the 5-year period.
Pitfall: Using the peak transfer rate ofa portion ofthe I/O system to make perfor 
mance projections or performance comparisons.
Many of the components of an I/O system, from the devices to the controllers to
the buses, are specified using their peak bandwidths. In practice, these peak band 
width measurements are often based on unrealistic assumptions about the system
