advertised number because of locality of disk references. This locality arises both
because of successive accesses to the same file and because the operating system
tries to schedule such accesses together.

The last component of a disk access, transfer time, is the time to transfer a block
of bits. The transfer time is a function of the sector size, the rotation speed, and
the recording density of a track. Transfer rates in 2004 are between 30 and 80
MB/sec. The one complication is that most disk controllers have a built-in cache
that stores sectors as they are passed over; transfer rates from the cache are typi 
cally higher and may be up to 320 MB/sec in 2004. Today, most disk transfers are
multiple sectors in length.
A disk controller usually handles the detailed control of the disk and the transfer
between the disk and the memory. The controller adds the final component of
disk access time, controller time, which is the overhead the controller imposes in
performing an I/O access. The average time to perform an I/O operation will con 
sist of these four times plus any wait time incurred because other processes are
using the disk.

rotating at 10,000 RPM? The advertised average seek time is 6 ms, the transfer
rate is 50 MB/sec, and the controller overhead is 0.2 ms. Assume that the disk
is idle so that there is no waiting time.
