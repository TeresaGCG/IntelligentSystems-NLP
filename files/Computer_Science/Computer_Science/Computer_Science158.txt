TEST Postbyte Immediate
FIGURE 2.45 TypIcal IA-32 Instruction formats. Figure 2.46 shows the encOOing of the postbyte.
Many instructions comain the I-bit field w, which says whether the operation is a byte or double word. The d
field in MOV is U'ied in instructions that fJl.1y move to or from memory and shows the direction of the move.
The ADD instruction requires 32 bits for the immediate field because in 32-bit mooe the imme&1tes are either
8 bits or 32 bils. The immediate field in the TEST is 32 bils long bec.1use there is no 8-bit immediate for test in
32-bit mooe. Overall, instructions may vary from I to 17 bytes in length. The long length comes from extra 1 
byte prefixes, having both a 4-byte inlmediate and a 4-byte displacement address, U'iing an opcooe of 2 bytes,
and U'iing the Sl:aled index mode specifier, which adds another byte.
IAÂ·32 Conclusion
Intel had a 16-bit microprocessor two years before its competitors' more elegant
architectures, such as the Motorola 68000, and this headstart led to the selection
of the 8086 as the CPU for the IBM Pc. Intel engineers generally acknowledge
that the IA-32 is more difficult to build than machines like MIPS, but the much
