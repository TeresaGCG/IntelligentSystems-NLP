2.16 Real Stuff: 1AÂ·32 Instructions 137
you familiarity with the strengths and weaknesses of the world's most popular
desktop architecture.
Rather than show the entire 16-bit and 32-bit instruction set, in this section we
concentrate on the 32-bit subset that originated with the 80386, as this portion of
the architecture is what is used. We start our explanation with the registers and
addressing modes, move on to the integer operations, and conclude with an
examination of instruction encoding.
IA-32 Registers and Data Addressing Modes
The registers of the 80386 shows the evolution of the instruction set (Figure 2.40).
The 80386 extended all 16-bit registers (except the segment registers) to 32 bits,

to 32 bits and could also be used as general-pufpose fegisters.
