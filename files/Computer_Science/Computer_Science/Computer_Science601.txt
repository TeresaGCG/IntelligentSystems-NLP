Elaboration: Another method for increasing the effective bus bandwidth is to
release the bus when it is not being used for transmitting information. This type of pro 
split transaction protocol A
tocol is called a split transaction protocol. The advantage of such a protocol is that, by
protocol in which the bus is
freeing the bus during the time data is not being transmitted, the protocol allows
released during a bus transac 
another requestor to use the bus. This can improve the effective bus bandwidth for the

for access by another requester.
The Buses and Networks of the Pentium 4
Figure 8.11 shows the I/O system of a PC based on the Pentium 4. The processor
connects to peripherals via two main chips. The chip next to the processor is the
memory controller hub, commonly called the north bridge, and the one connected
to it is the I/O controller hub, called the south bridge.

FtGURE 8.11 Organization of the I/O system on a Pentium 4 PC using the Intel 875 c:hlp
set. Note that the maximum transfer rate between the north bridge (memory hub) and south bridge (IIO
hub) is 266 MB/sec, which is why Intel put the AGP bus and Gig.1bit Ethernet on the north bridge.
