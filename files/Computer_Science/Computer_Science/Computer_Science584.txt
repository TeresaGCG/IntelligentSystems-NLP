FIGURE 8.2 The diversity of I/ O devices. YO devices can be distinguished by whether they serve as
input, output, or storage devices;their communication partner (people or other computers);and their peak
communication rates. The data rates span eight orders of magnitude. Note that a network can be an input
or an output device, but cannot be used for storage. Transfer rates for devices are always quoted in base 10,
so that 10 Mbit/sec = 10,000,000 bits/sec.
In other applications, we care primarily about response time, which you will
ItO requests Reads orwrites to recall is the total elapsed time to accomplish a particular task. If the 110 requests
I/O devices. are extremely large, response time will depend heavily on bandwidth, but in many
environments most accesses will be small, and the I/O system with the lowest
latency per access will deliver the best response time. On single-user machines
such as desktop computers and laptops, response time is the key performance
characteristic.
A large number of applications, especially in the vast commercial market for
computing, require both high throughput and short response times. Examples
include automatic teller machines (ATMs), order entry and inventory tracking
systems, file servers, and Web servers. In such environments, we care about both
how long each task takes and how many tasks we can process in a second. The
number of ATM requests you can process per hour doesn't matter if each one
takes 15 minutes-you won't have any customers left! Similarly, if you ca n process
each ATM request quickly but can only handle a small number of requests at once,
you won't be able to support many ATMs, or the cost of the computer per ATM
will be very high.
In summary, the three classes of desktop, server, and embedded computers are
sensitive to I/O dependability and cost. Desktop and embedded systems are more
