transaction by sending additional blocks of data until the transaction is com 
plete. Modify Figure 8.10 (both the steps and diagram) to indicate how such a
transfer might take place. Assuming that each handshaking step takes 20 and
tlS
memory access takes 60 ns, how long does it take to complete a transfer? What is
the maximum sustained bandwidth for this asynchronous bus, and how does it
compare to the synchronous bus in the example?

8.27 (151 <§8.S> We wa nt to compare the maximum bandwidth for a synchro 
nous and an asynchronous bus. The synchronous bus has a clock cycle time of
50 ns, and each bus transmission takes 1clock cycle. The asynchronous bus requires
40 ns per handshake. The data portion ofboth buses is 32 bits wide. Find the band 
width for each bus when performing one-word reads from a 2oo-ns memory.
8.28 (20) <§8.S> Suppose we have a system with the following characteristics:
1. A memory and bus system supporting block access of 4 to 16 32-bit words.
2. A 64-bit synchronous bus clocked at 200 MHz, with each 64-bit transfer
taking 1 clock cycle, and 1 clock cycle required to send an address to mem 
ory.
3. Two clock cycles needed between each bus operation. (Assume the bus is
idle before an access.)
4. A memory access time for the first four words of 200 ns; each additional set
of four words can be read in 20 ns. Assume that a bus transfer of the most
recently read data and a read of the next four words can be overlapped.
Find the sustained bandwidth and the latency for a read of 2S6 words for transfers
that use 4-word blocks and for transfers that use 16-word blocks. Also compute
the effective number of bus transactions per second for each case. Recall that a
single bus transaction consists of an address transmission followed by data.
8.29 (10 ) <§8.S> Let's determine the impact of polling overhead forthree differ 
ent devices. Assume that the number of clock cycles for a polling operation 
including transferring to the polling routine, accessing the device, and restarting
the user program-is 400 and that the processor executes with a Soo-M Hz clock.
Determine the fraction of CPU time consumed for the following three cases,
assuming that you poll often enough so that no data is ever lost and assuming that
the devices are potentially always busy:
1. The mouse must be polled 30 times per second to ensure that we do not
miss any movement made by the user.
