64 Chapter 2 Instructions: Language of the Computer
The 16-bit address means a load word instruction can load any word within a
 
15 13
region of ± 2 or 32,768 bytes (±2 or 8192 words) of the address in the base reR
ister rs. Similarly, add immediate is limited to constants no larger than ± 2 .
(Chapter 3 explains how to represent negative numbers.) We see that more than
32 registers would be difficult in this format, as the rs and rt fields would each
need another bit, making it harder to fit everything in one word.
Let's look at the load word instruction from page 57:
1w $t O,32 ( $s 3 l # Temporary reg $t O ge t s A[8]
Here, 19 (for $ 53) is placed in the rs field, 8 (fo r $tO) is placed in the rt field, and
32 is placed in the address field. Note that the meaning of the rt field has changed
for this instruction: in a load word instruction, the rt field specifies the destina 
tion register, which receives the result of the load.
Although multiple formats complicate the hardware, we can reduce the com 
plexity by keeping the formats similar. For example, the first three fields of the R 
type and I-type formats are the same size and have the same names; the fourth
field in I-type is equal to the length of the last three fields of R-type.
In case you were wondering, the formats are distinguished by the values in the
first field: each format is assigned a distinct set of values in the first field (op) so
that the hardware knows whether to treat the last half of the instruction as three
fields (R-type) or as a single field (I-type). Figure 2.6 shows the numbers used in
each field for the MIPS instructions covered through Section 2.3.

FIGURE 2.6 MIPS Instruction encoding. In the table above, "reg~ means a register number between
o and 31, ·address~ means a I6-bit address, and "n.a.~ (not applic.1ble) means this field does not appear in
this format. Note that add and sub instructions have the &1me value in the op field; the hardware uses the
nUlct field to decide the variant of the operation:add (32) or subtract (34).
