2. The floppy disk transfers data to the processor in 16-bit units and has a data
rate of 50 KB/sec. No data transfer can be missed.
3. The hard disk transfers data in four-word chunks and can transfer at
4 MB/sec. Again, no transfer can be missed.
8.30 [IS) <§§8.3-8.6> For the I/O system described in Exercise 8.45, find the
maximum instantaneous bandwidth at which data can be transferred from disk to
memory using as many disks as needed. How many disks and I/O buses (the min 
imum ofeach) do you need to achieve the bandwidth? Since you need only achieve
this bandwidth for an instant, latencies need not be considered.

8.33 [5] <§8.6> Suppose you are designing a microprocessor that uses special
instructions to access I/O devices (instead of mapping the devices to memory
addresses). What special instructions would you need to include? What additional
bus lines would you need this microprocessor to support in order to address I/O
devices?
8.34 <§8.6> An important advantage of interrupts over polling is the ability of
the processor to perform other tasks while waiting for communication from an I/O
device. Suppose that a I GHz processor needs to read 1000 bytes of data from a par 
ticular I/O device. The I/O device supplies I byte of data every 0.02 ms. The code
to process the data and store it in a buffer takes 1000 cycles.
a. If the processor detects that a byte of data is ready through polling, and a
polling iteration takes 60 cycles, how many cycles does the entire operation
take?
b. If instead, the processor is interrupted when a byte is ready, and the proces 
sor spends the time between interrupts on another task, how many cycles of
this other task can the processor complete while the I/O communication is
taking place? The overhead for handling an interrupt is 200 cycles.

8.38 (10 ) <§8.6> Write a paragraph identifying some ofthe simplifying assump 
tions made in the analysis below:
Suppose we have a processor that executes with a Soo-M Hz clock and the number
of clock cycles for a polling operation- including transferring to the polling rou 
tine, accessing the devise, and restarting the user program-is 400. The hard disk
