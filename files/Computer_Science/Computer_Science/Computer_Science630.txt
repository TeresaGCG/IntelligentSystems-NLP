FIGURE 8.17 Example output of Skippy for a hypothetical disk.
8.8 [ IOJ <§8.3> Consider two RAID disk systems that are meant to store 10 ter 
abytes of data (not counting any redundancy). System A uses RAID 1 technology,
and System B uses RAID 5 technology with four disks in a "protection group."
How m any mo re terabytes of storage are needed in System A than in System
3.

b. Suppose an application writes one block of data to the disk. If reading or
writing a block takes 30 how much time will the write take on System A
inS,
in the worst case? How about on System B in the worst case?
c. Is System A mo re reliable that System B? Why o r why not?
8.9 (15 <§8.3> What can happen to a RAID 5 system if the power fails between
J
the write update to the data block and the write update to the check block so that
only one of the two is successfully written? What could be done to prevent this
from happening?

8.10 [5J <§8.3> The speed of light is approximately 3 X 10 meters per second,
and electrical signals travel at about 50% of this speed in a conductor. When the
