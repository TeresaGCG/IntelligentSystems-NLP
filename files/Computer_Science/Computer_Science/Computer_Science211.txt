3.6 Floating Point 195
Thus IEEE 754 notation ca n be processed by integer compares to accelerate
sorting of floating-point numbers. Let's show the representation.
Floating-Point Representation
Show the IEEE 754 binary representation of the number -0.75 in single
ten
EXAMPLE
and double precision.
The number -0.75 is also
ten
ANSWER
2
-3/4 or -3/2
ten ten
It is also represented by the binary fraction
- lltwo/22ten or -0. 11 two
In scientific notation, the value is
0
-0.1 Itwo X 2
and in normalized scientific notation, it is
r'
X
- 1.11\\oU
The general representation for a single precision number is
+
(_I)s X ( I Fraction) X iExponent - 127)
r',
When we subtract the bias 127 from the exponent of - 1.l X the result
two
"
i
+ 126
(-I)' X ( I .1000 0000 0000 0000 0000 000t\Â» X - 127)
The single precision binary representation of -0.75 is then
ten
