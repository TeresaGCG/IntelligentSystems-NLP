MIPS operands
Name Example Comments
SsO. Ssl. Fast locations for data. In MIPS, data must be in registers to perform arithmetic.
• • • •
32 registers
stO. stl.
• • •
Memory(OI, Accessed only by data transfer instructions in MIPS. MIPS uses byte addresses, so
230 memory
Memory(4l, ... , sequential word addresses differ by 4. Memory holds data structures, arrays, and
words
Memory(42949672921 spilled registers.
MIPS assembly language

FIGURE 2.4 MIPS architecture revealed through Section 2.3. Highlighted portions show MIPSassembly language
structures introduced in Section 2.3.
Figure 2.4 summarizes the portions of the symbolic representation of the MIPS
instruction set described in this section. Load word and store word are the
instructions that copy words between memory and registers in the MIPS architec 
ture. Other brands of computers use instructions along with load and store to
transfer data. An architecture with such alternatives is the Intel IA-32, described in
Section 2. 16.
Given the importance of registers, what is the rate of increase in the number of Check
registers in a chip over time? Yourself
I. Very fast: They increase as fa st as Moore's law, which predicts doubling the
number of transistors on a chip every 18 months.
2. Very slow: Since programs are usually distributed in the language of the
computer, there is inertia in instruction set architecture, and so the number
of registers increases only as fast as new instruction sets become viable.
Elaboration: Although the MIPS registers in this book are 32 bits wide, there is a 64 
bit version of the MIPS instruction set with 32 64-bit registers. To keep them straight,
they are officially called MIPS-32 and MIPS-64. In this chapter, we use a subset of
MIPS-32. Appendix D shows the differences between MIPS·32 and MIPS-54.
