cache, which usually refers to the number ofbytes ofdata stored in the cache. The
number of bits needed to implement the cache represents the total amount of
memory needed for storing all the data, tags, and valid bits.
7.13 (10 ) <§7.2> Find a method to eliminate the AND gate on the valid bit in
Figure 7.7 on page 478. (Hint: You need to change the comparison.)
7.14 [IOJ <§7.2> Consider a memory hierarchy using one of the three organiza 
tions for main memory shown in Figure 7.11 on page 489. Assume that the cache
block size is 16 words, that the width oforganization (b) of the figure is four words,
and that the number ofbanks in organization (c) is four. Ifthe main memory latency
for a new access is 10 memory bus clock cycles and the transfer time is 1memory bus
clock cycle, what are the miss penalties for each ofthese organizations?
7.15 (10 ) <§7.2> • For More Practice: Cache Performance.
7.16 [IS) <§7.2> Cache C 1 is direct-mapped with 16 one-word blocks. Cache C2
is direct-mapped with 4 four-word blocks. Assume that the miss penalty for C 1 is
8 memory bus clock cycles and the miss penalty for C2 is 11 memory bus clock cy 
cles. Assuming that the caches are initially empty, find a reference string for which
C2 has a lower miss rate but spends more memory bus clock cycles on cache misses
than C 1. Use word addresses.

7.20 (10) <§7.2> Assume a memory system that supports interleaving either four
reads or four writes. Given the following mem ory addresses in order as they ap 
pear on the memory bus: 3, 9, 17,2,5 1, 37, 13, 4,8,41 ,67, 10, which ones will result
in a bank conflict?
7.21 [3 hours) <§7.3> Use a cache simulator to simulate several different cache
orga nizations for the first 1 million references in a trace of gce. Both dinero (a
cache simulator) and the gcc traces are available-see the Preface of this book for
information on how to obtain them. Assume an instruction cache of 32 KB and a
data cache of32 KB using the same orga nization. You should choose at least two
kinds of associativity and two block sizes. Draw a diagram like that in Figure 7. 17
on page 503 that shows the data cache o rganization with the best hit rate.
7.22 [I dayJ <§7.3> You are commissioned to design a cache fora new system. It
has a 32-bit physical byte address and requires separate instruction and data cach 
es. The SRAMs have an access time of 1.5 ns and a size of32K X8 bits, and you have
+
a total of 16 SRAMs to use. The miss penalty for the mem ory system is 8 2 x Block
