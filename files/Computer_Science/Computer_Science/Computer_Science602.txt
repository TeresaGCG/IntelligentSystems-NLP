586 Chapter 8
The north bridge is basically a DMA controller, connecting the processor to
memory, the AG P graphic bus, and the south bridge chip. The south bridge con 
nects the north bridge to a cornucopia of I/O buses. Intel and others offer a wide
va riety of these chip sets to connect the Pentium 4 to the outside world. To give a
flavor of the options, Figure 8.12 shows two of the chip sets.
As Moore's law continues, an increasing number of I/O controllers that were
formerly available as optional cards that connected to I/O buses have been co 
opted into these chip sets. For example, the south bridge chip of the Intel 875
includes a striping RAID controller, and the north bridge chip of the Intel 845GL
includes a graphics controller.

FIGURE 8.12 Two Pentium 4 I/O chip sets from Intel. The 845GL north bridge uses many fewer
pins than the 875 by having just one memory bus and by omitting the AGP bus and the Gigabit Ethernet
interface. Note that the serial nature of USB and Serial ATA means that two more USB ports and two more
Serial ATA ports need just 39 more pins in the south bridge of the 875 versus the 845GL chip sets.
