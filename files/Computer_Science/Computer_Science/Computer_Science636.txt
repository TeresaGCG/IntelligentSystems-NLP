transfers data in four-word chunks and can transfer at 4 MB/sec. Assume that you
poll often enough that no data is ever lost and assume that the hard disk is poten 
tially always busy. The initial senlp of a DMA transfer takes 1000 clock cycles for
the processor, and the handling of the interrupt at DMA completion requires 500
clock cycles for the processor. The hard disk has a transfer rate of 4 MB/sec and
uses DMA. Ignore any impact from bus contention between the processor and the
DMA controller. Therefore, if the average transfer from the disk is 8 KB, the frac 
tion of the 500-MHz processor consumed if the disk is actively transferring 100%
of the time is 0.2%.
8.39 (81 <§8.6> Suppose we have the same hard disk and processor we used in
Exercise 8.18, but we use interrupt-driven I/O. The overhead for each transfer,
including the interrupt, is 500 clock cycles. Find the fra ction of the processor con 
sumed ifthe hard disk is only transferring data 5% of the time.
8.40 [8] <§8.6> Suppose we have the same processor and hard disk as in Exercise
8.18. Assume that the initial setup of a DMA transfer takes 1000 clock cycles for the
processor, and assume the handling of the interrupt at DMA completion requires
500 clock cycles for the processor. The hard disk has a transfer rate of 4 MB/sec and
uses DMA. If the average transfer from the disk is 8 KB, what fraction of the 500 
MHz processor is consumed if the disk is actively transferring 100% of the time?
Ignore any impact from bus contention between the processor and DMA control 
ler.

8.44 [IS) <§§8.3--8.7> Redo the example on page 60 1, but instead assume that
the reads are random 8-KB reads. You can assume that the reads are always to an
idle disk, if one is available.
8.45 (20) <§§8.3-8.7> Here are a variety ofbuilding blocks used in an I/O system
that has a synchronous processor-memory bus running at 800 MHz and one or
more I/O adapters that interface I/O buses to the processor-memory bus.
• Memory system: The memory system has a 32-bit interface and handles
four-word transfers. The memory system has separate address and data lines
and, for writes to memory, accepts a word every clock cycle for 4 clock cycles
and then takes an additional 4 clock cycles before the words have been
stored and it ca n accept another transaction.
