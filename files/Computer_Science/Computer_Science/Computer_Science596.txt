Which of the following are true about dependability?
Yourself
I. If :l system is up, then all its components are accomplishing their expected
service.
2. Availability is a quantitative measure of the percentage of time a system is
accomplishing its expected service.
3. Reliability is a quantitative measure of continuous service accomplishment
by a system.
4. The major source of outages today is software.
\Vhich of the following are true about RAID levels 1,3, 4, 5, and 6?
I. RAID systems rely on redundancy to achieve high ava ilability.
2. RAID 1 (mirroring) has the highest check disk overhead.
3. For small writes, RAID 3 (bit-interleaved parity) has the worst throughput.
4. For large writes, RAID 3, 4, and 5 have the same throughput.
Elaboration: One issue is how mirroring interacts with striping. Suppose you had,
say, four disks worth of data to store and eight physical disks to use. Would you create
four pairs of disks-each organized as RAID 1-and then stripe data across the four
RAID 1 pairs? Alternatively, would you create two sets offour disks-each organized as
RAID o-and then mirror writes to both RAID 0 sets? The RAID terminology has evolved
to call the former RAID 1 + 0 or RAID 10 ("striped mirrors") and the latter RAID 0 + 1 or
RAID 01 ("mirrored stripes").
Networks
Networks are growing in popularity over time, and unlike other I/O devices, there
are many books and courses on them. For readers who have not taken courses or
read books on networking, Section 8.3 on the " CD gives a quick overview of the
topics and terminology, including internetworking, the OS! model, protocol fam 
ilies such as TCPIlP, long-haul networks such as ATM , local area networks such as
Ethernet, and wireless networks such as IEEE 802.11.
