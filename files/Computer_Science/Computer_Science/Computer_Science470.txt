454 Chapter 6 Enhancing Performance with Plpellnlng
With remarkable advances in processing, Amdahl's law suggests that another pa rt
of the system will become the bottleneck. That bottleneck is the topic of the next
chapter: the memory system.
An alternative to pushing uniprocessors to automatically exploit parallelism at
the instruction level is trying multiprocessors, which exploit parallelism at much
II
coarser levels. Parallel processing is the topic of Chapter 9, which appears on the
CD.
Historical Perspective and Further
Reading
This section, which appears on the CD, discusses the history of the first pipelined
processors, the earliest superscalars, the development of ollt-of-order and specula 
tive techniques, as well as important developments in the accompanying com piler
technology.
Exercises
6.1 [5] <ยง6.1 > If the time for an ALU operation can be shortened by 25% (com  
pared to the description in Figure 6.2 on page 373);
a. Will it affect the speedup obtained from pipelining? If yes, by how much?
Otherwise, why?
b. What if the ALU operation now takes 25% more time?
6.2 (10) <ยง6.1 > A computer architect needs to design the pipeline of a new m icro 
6
p rocessor. She has an example workload program core with 10 instructions. Each
instruction takes 100 ps to finish.
a. How long does it take to execute this program core on a nonpipelined proces 
sor?
b. The current state-of-the-art microprocessor has about 20 pipeline stages.
Assume it is perfectly pipelined. How much speedup will it achieve compared
to the nonpipelined p rocessor?
c. Real pipelining isn't perfect, since implementing pipelining introduces some
overhead per pipeline stage. Will this overhead affect instruction latency,
instruction throughput, o r both?
