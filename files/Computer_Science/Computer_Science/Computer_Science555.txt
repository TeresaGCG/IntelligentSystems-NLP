FIGURE 7.29 The key quantitative design parameters that characterize the major elements of memory hierarchy In a com 
puter. These are typical values for these levels as of 2004. Although the range ofvalues is wide, this is partially because many of the values that have
shifted over time are related; for example, as caches become larger to overcome larger miss penalties, block sizes also grow.

Associativity
FIGURE 7.30 The data cache miss rates for each of eight cache sizes Improve as the
associativity Increases. While the benefit of going from one-way (direct-mapped) to two-way set
associative is significant, the benefits offurther associativity are smaller (e.g., 1%- 10% going from t\loU-way
to four-way versus 20%--30% improvement going from one-way to two-way). There is even less improve 
ment in going from four-way to eight-way set associative, which, in turn, comes very dose to the miss rates
of a fully associative cache. Smaller caches obtain a significantly larger absolute benefit from associativity
because the base miss rate ofa small cache is larger. Figure 7.15 explains how this data was collected.
KB to 512 KB, varying from direct mapped to eight-way set associative. The larg 
est gains are obtained in going from direct mapped to two-way set associative,
which yields between a 20% and 30% reduction in the miss rate. As cache sizes
grow, the relative improvement from associativity increases only slightly; since the
overall miss rate of a larger cache is lower, the opportunity for improving the miss
rate decreases and the absolute improvement in the miss rate from associativity
