FIGURE 8.3 Six magnetic disks, varying In diameter from 14 Inches down to 1.8 Inches.
The IBM microdrive, not shown, has a I-inch diameter. The pictured disks were introduced over more than
IS years ago and hence are not intended to be representative of the best capacity of modern disks ofthese
diameters. This photograph does, however, accurately portray their relative physical sizes.The widest disk is
the DEC R81, containing four 14·jnch diameter planers and storing 456 MB.1t was manufactured in 1985.
The 8-inch diameter disk comes from Fujitsu, and this 1984 disk stores 130 MB on six platters.The Microp 
olis RDS3 has five S.lS·inch planers and stores 85 MB. The IBM 0361 also has five platters, bUllhese are just
3.5 inches in diameter. This 1988 disk holds 320 MB. In 2004, the most dense 3.5·inch disk had 2 platters
and holds 200 GB in the same space, yielding an increase in density of abom 600 times! The Conner CP
2045 has two 2.5·inch platters containing 40 MB and was made in 1990. The smallest disk in this photo·
graph is the Integral 1820. This single 1.8·inch platter contains 20 MB and was made in 1992. Figure 8.11
on page 585 shows a lO·inch drive that holds 340 ME.
Thus, you need a reference specification of expected behavior to be able to
determine dependability. Users ca n then see a system alternating between two
states of delivered service with respect to the service specification:
I. Service accomplishment, where the service is delivered as specified
2. Service interruption, where the delivered service is different from the speci-
fied service
Transitions from state 1 to state 2 are caused by failures, and transitions from state
2 to state 1 are called restorations. Failures can be permanent or intermittent. The
latter is the more difficult case to diagnose when a system oscillates between the
two states; permanent failures are much easier to diagnose. This definition leads
to two related terms: reliability and availability.
