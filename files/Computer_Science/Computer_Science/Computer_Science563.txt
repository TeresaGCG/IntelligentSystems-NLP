7.6 Real Stuff: The Pentium P4 and the AMD Opteron Memory Hierarchies 547
The Memory Hierarchies of the P4 and Opteron
Figure 7.34 summarizes the address sizes and TLBs of the two processors.
Note that the AMD Opteron has four TLBs while the P4 has two and that the
virtual and physical addresses do not have to match the word size. AMD imple 
ments only 48 of the potential 64 bits of its virtual space and 40 of the potential 64
bits of its physical address space. Intel increases the physical address space to 36 
bits, although no single program can address more than 32 bits.
Figure 7.35 shows their caches. Note that both the L1 data cache and the L2
caches are larger in the Opteron and that P4 uses a larger block size for its L2
cache than its L1 data cache.
Although the Opteron runs the same IA-32 programs as the Pentium P4, its
biggest difference is that it has added a 64-bit addressing mode. Just as the 80386
added a flat 32-bit address space and 32-bit registers to the prior 16-bit 80286
architecture, Opteron adds a new mode with flat 64-bit address space and 64-bit
registers to the IA-32 architecture, called AMD64. It increases the program
counter to 64 bits, extends eight 32-bit registers to 64 bits, adds eight new 64-bit
registers, and doubles the number of SSE2 registers. In 2004 Intel announced that
future IA-32 processors will include their 64-bit address extension.
Techniques to Reduce Miss Penalties
Both the Pentium 4 and the AMD Opteron have additional optimizations that
allow them to reduce the miss penalty. The first of these is the return of the

FtGURE 7.34 Address translation and TLB hardware for the Intel Pentium P4 and AMD
Opteron. The word size sets the maximum size of the virtual address, but a processor need not use all bits.
The physical address size is independem of m>rd size. The P4 has one TLB for instructions and a separate
identical TLB for data, while the Opteron has both an L1 TLB and an L2 TLB for instructions and identical
LI and L2 TLBs for data. Both processors provide support for large pages, which are used for things like the
operating system or mapping a frame buffer.The large-page scheme avoids using a large mUlIber of entries
to map a single object that is always present.
