Compiling a String Copy Procedure, Showing How to Use C Strings
EXAMPLE The procedure s tr cpy copies string y to string x uSlIlg the null byte

\-Vhat is the MIPS assembly code?
Below is the basic MIPS assembly code segment. Assume that base addresses
ANSWER
for arrays x and yare found in $aQ and $a l, while i is in $50. s trcpy ad 
justs the stack pointer and then saves the saved register $sOon the stack:
str cpy :
addi $sp , $sp ,-4 It adjus t st ac k fo r 1 more i t em
sw $50 , O( $ sp) It save $50
To initialize i to 0, the next instruction sets $s 0 to 0 byadding 0 to 0 and plac 
ing that sum in $s 0:
add $sO , $zero , $ze r o It i 0 + 0
=
This is the beginning of the loop. The address of y [ i ] is first formed by add 
ingi toy[] :
It
Ll : add $tl,$sO , $al add r ess of y[i] in $tl
Note that we don't have to multiply i by 4 since y is an array of bytes and not
of words, as in prior examples.
To load the character in y [i ], we use load byte, which puts the character into
