FIGURE 8.5 Summary of studies of reasons for failures. Although it is difficult to coUeet data
to determine jf operators are the cawe of errors, since operators often record the reasons for failures, these
studies did capture that data. There were often other categories, such as environmental reasons for oulage&,
bUlthey were generally small. The top two rows come from a classic paper by lim Gray [19901, which is still
widely quoted almost 20 years after the data was collected. The next two rows are from a paper by Murphy
and Gent who studied causes of outages in VAX systems over time ("Measuring system and software reli·
ability using an automated data collection process," Quality and Reliability Engineering International 11:5,
September-Dctober 1995,341- 53). The fifth and sixth rows are studies of FCC failure data about the u .s.
public switched telephone network by Kuhn ("Sources offailure in the public switched telephone net\\oUrk,~
IEEE Computer 30:4, April 1997,31- 36) and by Patty Enriquez.The most recent study ofthree Internet ser·
vices is from Oppenheimer, Ganapath, and Patterson [20031.
To increase MTTF, you can improve the quality of the components or design
systems to continue operation in the presence of components that have fa iled.
Hence, failure needs to be defined with respect to a context. A failure in a compo 
nent may not lead to a failure of the system. To make this distinction clear, the
term fault is used to mea n failure of a component. Here are three ways to improve
MTTF,
I. Fault avoidance: preventing fault occurrence by construction
2. Fault tolerance: using redundancy to allow the service to comply with the
service specification despite faults occurring, which applies primarily to
hardware faults
3. Fault forecasting: predicting the presence and creation of faults, which
applies to hardwa re and software faults
Shrinking MTTR can help availability as much as increasing MITE For exa mple,
tools fo r fault detection, diagnosis, and repair can help reduce the time to repair
faults by people, software, and hardware.
