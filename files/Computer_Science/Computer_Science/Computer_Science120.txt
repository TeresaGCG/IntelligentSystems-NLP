Yourself
I. Addresses between 0 and 64K - I
2. Addresses between 0 and 256K - I
3. Addresses up to about 32K before the branch to about 32K after
4. Addresses up to about 128K before the branch to about 128K after
What is the range of addresses for jump and jump and link in M IPS (M = 1024K)?
1. Addresses between 0 and 64M - I
