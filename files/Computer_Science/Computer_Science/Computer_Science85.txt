FtGURE 2.9 C and Java logical operators and their corresponding MIPS Instructions.
The first class of such operations is called shifts. They move all the bits in a
word to the left or right, filling the emptied bits with as. For example, if register
$s a contained
0000 0000 0000 00000 000 0000 0000 0000 1001 = 9
two ten
and the instruction to shift left by 4 was executed, the new value would look like
th is:
0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 1001 OOOOtwo= 144
ten
The dual of a shift left is a shift right. The actual name of the two MIPS shift
instructions are called shift left logical (s 11) and shift right logical (s r 1). The fol 
lowing instruction performs the operation above, assuming that the result should
go in register H2:
«
511 HZ . $sO .4 # reg $tZ reg $sO 4 bits
=
We delayed explaining the shamt field in the R-format. It stands for shift
amount and is used in shift instructions. Hence, the machine language version of
the instruction above is
0'
'd shamt funct
o o o
16 10 4
The encoding of sll is a in both the op and funct fields, rd contains HZ, rt con 
tains $sO, and shamt contains 4. The rs field is unused, and thus is set to O.
Shift left logical provides a b.onus benefit. Shifting left by i bits gives the
same result as multiplying by 2' (Chapter 3 explains why). For exa mrle, the
above s 11 shifts by 4, which gives the same result as multiplying by 2 or 16.
