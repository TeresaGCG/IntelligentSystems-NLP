600 Chapter 8
The new CPU times and the resulting elapsed times are computed in the fol 
lowing table:
I/O I/O
After II years CPU time time Elapsed time % time
0 90 seconds 10 seconds 100 seconds 10%
1 jUl ~ 60 seconds 10 seconds 70 seconds 14%

3 ~ " 27 seconds 10 seconds 37 seconds 27%
4 ~ " 18 seconds 10 seconds 28 seconds 36%
5 ..11i " 12 seconds 10 seconds 22 seconds 45%

The improvement in CPU performance over five years is
90 = 7.5
12
However, the improvement in elapsed time is only
100 = 4.5
22
and the I/O time has increased from 10% to 45% of the elapsed time.
Check
Are the following true or false? Unlike processor benchmarks, I/O benchmarks
Yourself
I. concentrate on throughput rather than latency
2. can require that the data set scale in size or number of users to achieve per 
formance milestones
3. come from organizations rather than from individuals
Designing an I/O System
There are two primary types of specifications that designers encounter in I/O sys 
tems: latency constraints and bandwidth constraints. In both cases, knowledge of
the traffic pattern affects the design and analysis.
Latency constraints involve ensuring that the latency to complete an I/O opera 
tion is bounded by a certain amount. In the simple case, the system may be
