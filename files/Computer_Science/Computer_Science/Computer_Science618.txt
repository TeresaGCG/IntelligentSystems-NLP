602 Chapter 8
If the workload consists of 64 KB reads (where the block is sequential on a
track) and the user program needs 200,000 instructions per I/O operation,
find the maximum sustainable I/O rate and the number of disks and SCSI
controllers required. Assume that the reads can always be done on an idle
disk if one exists (i.e., ignore disk conflicts).
The two fixed components of the system are the memory bus and the CPU.
ANSWER
Let's first find the I/O rate that these two components can sustain and deter 
mine which of these is the bottleneck. Each I/O takes 200,000 user instruc 
tions and 100,000 OS instructions, so
Maximum I/O rate of CPU =
Instruction execution pte 3 X I.!LQ'_--: 10,000 --lL.Q.L
Instructions per I/O 3 second
+
(200 100) X 10
Each I/O transfers 64 KB, so
Bus bandwidtb = 1DOD X IJf = IS,625-.lLili....
Maximum I/O rate ofbus =
Bytes per I/O 64 X 103 second
The CPU is the bottleneck, so we can now configure the rest of the system to
perform at the level dictated by the CPU, 10,000 I/Os per second.
Let's determine how many disks we need to be able to accommodate 10,000
I/Os per second. To find the number of disks, we first find the time per I/O op 
eration at the disk:
+ +
Time per I/O at disk = Seek rotational time Transfer time
+ ~
= 6 ms = 6.9 ms
75 MB/sec
Thus, each disk can complete 1000 ms/6.9 ms or 146 I/Os per second. To sat 
urate the CPU requires 10,000 I/Os per second, or 10,000/ 146'" 69 disks.
To compute the number of SCSI buses, we need to check the average trans 
fer rate per disk to see if we can sanlfate the bus, which is given by
Transfer rate = Transfer size = 64 KB '" 9.56 MB/sec
Transfer time 6.9 ms
The maximum number of disks per SCSI bus is 7, which won't saturate this
bus. This means we will need 69/7, or 10 SCSI buses and controllers.
