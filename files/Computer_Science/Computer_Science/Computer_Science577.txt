7.48 [8J <§7.5> Extend your solution to Exercise 7.46 by including the specifica 
tion of a new procedure for handling write accesses, assuming a write-through pol 
icy. Be sure to consider whether or not your solution for handling read accesses
needs to be modified.
7.49 [8J <§7.5> Extend your solution to Exercise 7.46 by including the specifica 
tion of a new procedure for handling write accesses, assuming a write-back policy.
Be sure to consider whether or not your solution for handling read accesses needs
to be modified.
7.50 [S) <§7.5> This exercise is similar to Exercise 7.48, but this time extend your
solution to Exercise 7.47. Assume that the cache uses random replacement.
7.51 [S) <§7.5> This exercise is similar to Exercise 7.49, but this time extend your
solution to Exercise 7.47. Assume that the cache uses random replacement.
7.52 (5) <§§7.7-7.S> Why might a compiler perform the following optimization?
/ * Be f ore */
<
fo r (j 0 ; j 20 ; j ++ l
=
<
f or (i 0 ; i 200 ; i ++ )
=
x[i][j] x[i][j] + 1 ;
=
/ * Aft er */
<
fo r (i 0 ; i 200 ; i ++ l
=
<
f or (j 0 ; j 20 ; j ++ )
=
x[i][j] - x[i][j] + 1 ;

§7.2, page 49 1: I and 4: A lower miss penalty can lead to smaller blocks, yet higher
Check Yourself
memory bandwidth usually leads to larger blocks, since the miss penalty is only
slightly larger.
