FIGURE 5.11 The simple datapath for the MIPS architecture combines the elements required by different Instruction
classes. This datapath can execute the basic instructions (load/store word,ALU operations,and branches) in a single dock cycle.An additional mulÂ·
tiplexor is needed to integrate branches. The support for jumps will be added later.
A Simple Implementation Scheme
In this section, we look at what might be thought of as the simplest possible
implementation of our MIPS subset. We build this simple implementation using
the datapath of the last section and adding a simple control function. This simple
implementation covers load word (1 w), store word ( sw), branch equal (beq), and
the arithmetic-logical instructions add, sub, and, or, and set on less than.
We will later enhance the design to include a jump instruction (j ).
