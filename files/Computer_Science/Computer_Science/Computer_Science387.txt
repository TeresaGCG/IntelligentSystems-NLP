FIGURE 6.1 The laundry analogy for p1pellnlng. Ann, Brian, Cathy, and Don each have dirty
clothes to be washed, dried, folded, and put away. The washer, dryer, ~folder," and "storer" each take 30
minutes for their task. Sequential laundry takes 8 hours for four loads of wash, while pipelined laundry
takes just 3.5 hours. We show the pipeline stage of different loads over time by showing copies of the four
resources on this two-dimensional time line, but we really have just one of each resource.
take about 5 times as long as 1 load, while 20 loads of sequential laundry takes 20
times as long as 1 load. It's only 2.3 times faster in Figure 6.1 because we only
show 4 loads. Notice that at the beginning and end of the workload in the pipe 
lined version in Figure 6. 1, the pipeline is not completely full, this start-up and
wind-down affects performance when the number of tasks is not large compared
to the number of stages in the pipeline. If the number of loads is much larger than
4, then the stages will be full most of the time and the increase in throughput will
be very close to 4.
The same principles apply to processors where we pipeline instruction
execution. MIPS instructions classically take five steps:
1. Fetch instruction from memory.
2. Read registers while decoding the instruction. The format of MIPS instruc 
tions allows reading and decoding to occur simultaneously.
