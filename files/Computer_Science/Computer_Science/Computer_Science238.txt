Pitfall: The MIPS instruction add immediate unsigned add i u sign-extends its 16 
bit immediatefield.
Despite its name, add immediate unsigned (addi u) is used to add constants to
signed integers when we don't care about overflow. MIPS has no subtract immedi 
ate instruction and negative numbers need sign extension, so the M IPS architects
decided to sign-extend the immediate field.
Fallacy: Only theoretical mathematicians care about j1oating-point accuracy.
Newspaper headlines of November 1994 prove this statement is a fallacy (see Fig 
ure 3.23). The following is the inside sto ry behind the headlines.
The Pentium uses a standard floating-point divide algorithm that generates
multiple quotient bits per step, using the most significa nt bits of divisor and divi 
dend to guess the next 2 bits of the quotient. The guess is taken from a lookup
table containing -2, - 1, 0, + 1, or +2. The guess is multiplied by the divisor and
