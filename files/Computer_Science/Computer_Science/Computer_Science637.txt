8.12 Exercises 621
• DMA interfaces: The I/O adapters use DMA to transfer the data between the
I/O buses and the processor-memory bus. The DMA unit arbitrates for the
processor-memory bus and sends/receives four-word blocks from/to the
memory system. The DMA controller can accommodate up to eight disks.
Initiating a new I/O operation (including the seek and access) takes 0.1 ms,
during which another I/O ca nnot be initiated by this controller (but out 
standing operations can be handled).
• I/O bus: The I/O bus is a synchronous bus with a sustainable bandwidth of
100 MB/sec; each transfer is one word long.
• Disks: The disks have a measured average seek plus rotational latency of 8
ms. The disks have a read/write bandwidth of 40 MB/sec, when they are
transferring.
Find the time required to read a 16 KB sector from a disk to memory, assuming
that this is the only activity on the bus.
8.46 [5 <§8.7> In order to perform a disk or network access, it is typically nec 
J
essary for the user to have the operating system communicate with the disk or net 
work controllers. Suppose that in a particular 5 GHz computer, it takes 10,000
cycles to trap to the as, 20 ms for the OS to perform a disk access, and 25 fls for
the as to perform a network access. In a disk access, what percentage of the delay
time is spent in trapping to the aS? How about in a network access?
8.47 [5 <§8.7> Suppose that in the computer in Exercise 8.46 we can somehow
J
reduce the time for the OS to communicate with the disk controller by 60%, and
we can reduce the time for the OS to communicate with the network by 40%. By
what percentage can we reduce the total time for a network access? By what per 
centage can we reduce the total time for a disk access? Is it worthwhile for us to
spend a lot of effort improving the as trap latency in a computer that performs
many disk accesses? How about in a computer that performs many network
accesses?
