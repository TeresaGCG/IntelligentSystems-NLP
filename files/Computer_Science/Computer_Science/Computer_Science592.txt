Bit-Interleaved Parity (RAID 3)
The cost of higher availability can be reduced to 1/N, where N is the number of

information on a failure. Reads or writes go to all disks in the group, with one
extra disk to hold the check information in case there is a fa ilure. RAID 3 is popu 
lar in applications with large data sets, such as multimedia and some scientific
codes.
Parity is one such scheme. Readers unfamiliar with parity can think of the
redundant disk as having the sum of all the data in the other disks. When a disk
fails, then you subtract all the data in the good disks from the parity disk; the
remaining information must be the missing information. Parity is simply the sum
modulo two.
