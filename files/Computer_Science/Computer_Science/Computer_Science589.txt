FIGURE 8.4 Characteristics of three magnetic disks by a single manufacturer In 2004. The disks shown here either interface to
SCSI, a standard I/O bus for many systems, or ATA, a standard I/O bus for PCS. The first disk is intended for file servers, the second for desktop PCs,
and the last for laptop computers. Each disk has an 8 MB cache.The transfer rate from the cache is 3-6 times faster than the transfer rate from the disk
surface. The much lower cost of the ATA 3.S-inch drive is primarily due to the hypercompetitive PC market, although there are differences in perfor 
mance and reliability between it and the SCSI drive. The service life for these disks is 5 years, although Seagate offers a S-year guarantee only on the
SCSI drive, with a I-year guarantee on the other two. Note that the quoted MTIF assumes nominal power and temperature. Disk lifetimes can be
much shorter if temperature and vibration are not controlled. See the link to Seagate at www.seagate.romfor more information on these drives.
Reliability is a measure of the continuous service accomplishment-or, equiva  small computer systems
interface (SCSI) Abus used as
lently, of the time to failure-from a reference point. Hence, the mean time to fail 
a standard for I/O devices.
ure (MTTF) of disks in Figure 8.4 is a reliability measure. Service interruption is
measured as mean time to repair (MTIR). Mean time between faill/res (MTBF) is
+
simply the sum of MTTF MTTR. Although MTBF is widely used, MTIF is
often the more appropriate term.
Availability is a measure of the service accomplishment with respect to the
alternation between the two states of accomplishment and interruption. Ava ilabil 
ity is statistically quantified as
Ava ilability MIIF==
(MTTF + MTTR)
Note that reliability and availability are quantifiable measures, rather than just
synonyms fo r dependability.
\Vhat is the cause of failures? Figure 8.5 summarizes many papers that have col 
lected data on reasons for computer systems and telecommunications systems to
fail. Clearly, human operators are a significant source of failures.
