FIGURE 2.47 The MIPS Instruction set covered so far, with the real MIPS Instructions on
the left and the pseudolnstruc:tlons on the right. â€¢ Appendix A (Section A. 10, on page A-45)
describes the full MIPS architecture. Figure 2.27 shows more details of the MIPS architecture revealed in
this chapter.
