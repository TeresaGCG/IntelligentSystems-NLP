FIGURE 5.19 The datapath In operation for an RÂ·type Instruction such as add St1. St2. St3. The control lines, datapath units,and
connections that are active are highlighted.
5. The data from the memory unit is written into the register file; the register
destination is given by bits 20: 16 of the instruction ($t 1) .
Finally, we can show the operation of the branch-on-equal instruction, such as
beq $t1 . $t2 . offset, in the same fashion. It operates much like an R-format
