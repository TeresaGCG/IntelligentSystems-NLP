\Vhen powered on, the microprocessor first runs diagnostics on all compo 
nents and writes any error messages to the liquid crystal display (LCD) on the
back of the camera. This camera uses a 1.8-inch low-temperature polysilicon TFT
color LCD. When photographers take picnlfes, they first hold the shutter halfway
so that the microprocessor can take a light reading. The microprocessor then
keeps the shutter open to get the necessary light, which is captured by a charged 
couple device (CeO) as red,green, and blue pixels.

For the camera in Figure 8.14, the is a 1/2-inch, 1360 X 1024 pixel, pro 
gressive-scan chip. The pixels are scanned out row by row and then passed
through routines for white balance, color, and aliasing correction, and then stored
in a 4 MBframe buffer. The next step is to compress the image into a standard for 
mat, such as IPEG, and store it in the removable Flash memory. The photographer
picks the compression, in this camera called either fine or normal, with a com 
pression ratio of 10 to 20 times. A fine-quality compressed image takes less than
0.5 MB, and a normal-quality compressed image takes about 0.25 MB. The micro 
processor then updates the LCD display to show that there is room for one less
picture.
Although the previous paragraph covers the basics of a digital camera, there are
many more features that are included: showing the recorded images on the color
LCD display; sleep mode to save battery life; monitoring battery energy; buffering
to allow recording a rapid sequence of uncompressed images; and, in this camera,
video recording using MPEG format and audio recording using WAY format.
This camera allows the photographer to use a Microdrive disk instead of Com 
pactFlash memory. Figure 8.1 5 compares CompactFlash and the IBM Microdrive.

FIGURE 8.15 Characteristics of three storage alternatives for digital cameras. Hitachi
matches the Type II form factor in the Microdrive, while the CompactFlash card uses that space to include
many more Flash chips. Hitachi does not quote MTTF for the 1.0·inch drives, bU1 the service life is five
years or 8800 powered-on hours, whichever is first. They rotate at 3600 RPM and have 12 ms seek times.
