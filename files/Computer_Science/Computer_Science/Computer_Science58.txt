42 Chapter 1 Computer Abstractions and Technology
1.56 (15) <§§ 1.1- 1.5> A less technically inclined friend has asked you to explain
how computers work. Write a detailed, one-page description for your friend.
1.57 (101 <§§ 1.1- 1.5> In what ways do you lack a dea r understa nding of how
computers work? Are there levels of abstraction with which you are particularly
unfamiliar? Are there levels ofabstraction with which you are familiar but still have
specific questions about? Write at least one paragraph addressing each of these
questions.
1.58 (15) <§ 1.3> In this exercise, you will learn more about interfaces or abstrac 
tions. For example, we can provide an abstraction for a disk like this:
Performance characteristics:
• Capacity (how much data can it store?)
• Bandwidth (how fast can data be transferred between the computer and
disk?)
• Latency (how long does it take to find a specific position for access?)
Functions the interface provides:
• Read/write data
• Seek to a specific position
• Status report (is the disk ready to read/write, etc.?)
Following this pattern, please provide an abstraction for a network card.

Answers to §1.1 , page 10: Discussion questions: lots of answers are acceptable.
Check Yourself §1.3, page 27: Disk memory: nonvolatile, long access time (milliseconds), and cost
$2-4/GB. Semiconductor memory: volatile, short access time (nanoseconds), and
cost $200-400/GB.
§1.4, page 33: I, 3, and 4 are valid reasons.
