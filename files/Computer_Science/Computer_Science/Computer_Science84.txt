FIGURE 2.8 The stored-program concept. Stored programs allow a computer that performs
accounting to become, in the blink ofan eye, a computer that helps an author WTite a book.The switch hap 
pens simply by loading memory with programs and data and then telling the computer to begin executing
at a given location in memory. Treating instructions in the same way as data greatly simplifies both the
memory hardware and the software of computer systems. Specifically, the memory technology needed for
data can also be used for programs, and programs like compilers, for instance, can translate code written in
a notation far more convenient for humans into code that the computer can understand.

Although the first computers concentrated on full words, it soon became clear that

it was useful to operate on fields of bits within a word or even on individual bits.

Examining characters within a word, each of which are stored as 8 bits, is one exam 
ple of such an operation. It follows that instructions were added to simplify, among
other things, the packing and unpacking of bits into words. These instructions are
called logical operations. Figure 2.9 shows logical operations in C and Java.
