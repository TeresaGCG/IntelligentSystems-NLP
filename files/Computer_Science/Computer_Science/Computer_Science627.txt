Historical Perspective and Further
Reading
II
The history of I/O systems is a fascinating one. This Section 8.11 gives a brief
history of magnetic disks, RAID, databases, the Internet, the World Wide Web,
and how Ethernet continues to triumph over its challengers.
Exercises
8.1 [10] <§§8.1-8.2> Here are two different I/O systems intended for use
III
transaction processing:
• System A can support 1500 I/O operations per second.
• System B can support 1000 I/O operations per second.
The systems use the same processor that executes 500 million instructions per sec 
ond. Assume that each transaction requires 5 I/O operations and that each I/O
operation requires 10,000 instructions. Ignoring response time and assuming that
transactions may be arbitrarily overlapped, what is the maximum transaction 
per-second rate that each machine can sustain?
8.2 [15] <§§8.1-8.2> The latency of an I/O operation for the two systems in Exer 
cise 8.1 differs. The latency for an I/O on system A is equal to 20 ms, while for sys 
tem B the latency is 18 ms for the first 500 I/Ds per second and 25 ms per I/O for
each I/O between 500 and 1000 I/Ds per second. In the workload, every 10th trans 
action depends on the immediately preceding transaction and must wait for its
completion. What is the maximum tratlsaction rate that still allows every transac 
tion to complete in I second and that does not exceed the I/O bandwidth of the
machine? (For simplicity, assume that all transaction requests arrive at the begin 
ning of a I-second interval.)
8.3 [5] <§§8.1-8.2> Suppose we want to use a laptop to send 100 files of approx 
imately 40 MB each to another computer over a 5 Mbit/sec wireless connection.
The laptop battery currently holds 100,000 oules of energy. The wireless network 
ing card alone consumes 5 watts while transmitting, while the rest of the laptop
always consumes 35 watts. Before each file transfer we need 10 seconds to choose
which file to send. How many complete files can we transfer before the laptop's
battery runs down to zero?
