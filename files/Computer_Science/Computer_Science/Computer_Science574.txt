7.28 [5J <§7.3> Associativity usually improves the miss ratio, but not always.
Give a short series of address references for which a two-way set-associative cache
with LRU replacement would experience more misses than a direct-mapped cache
of the same size.
7.29 (15) <§7.3> Suppose a com puter's address size is k bits (using byte address 
ing), the cache size is S bytes, the block size is B bytes, and the cache is A-way set 
b
associative. Assume that B is a power of two, so B = 2 . Figure out what the follow 
ing quantities are in terms of 5, B, A, b, and k: the number of sets in the cache, the
number of index bits in the address, and the number of bits needed to implement
the cache (see Exercise 7. 12).

7.32 (20 ) <§7.3> Consider three processors with different cache configurations:
• Cache 1: Direct-mapped with one-word blocks
• Cache 2: Direct-mapped with four-word blocks
• Cache 3: Two-way set associative with four-word blocks
The following miss rate measurements have been made:
• Cache 1: Instruction miss rate is 4%; data miss rate is 6%.
• Cache 2: Instruction miss rate is 2%; data miss rate is 4%.
• Cache 3: Instruction miss rate is 2%; data miss rate is 3%.
For these processors, one-half of the instructions contain a data reference. Assume
+
that the cache miss penalty is 6 Block size in words. The CPI for this workload
was measured on a processor with cache 1 and was found to be 2.0. Determine
which processor spends the most cycles on cache misses.
