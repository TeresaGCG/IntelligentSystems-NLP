fers that use 16-word blocks. Also compute the effective number of bus transac 
tions per second for each case.
8.20 [5 <§8.5> Exercise 8.19 demonstrates that using larger block sizes results in
J
an increase in the maximum sustained bandwidth that can be achieved. Under
what conditions might a designer tend to favor smaller block sizes? Specifically,
why would a designer choose a block size of 4 instead of 16 (assuming all of the
characteristics are as identified in Exercise 8.19)?
8.21 [15) <§8.5> This question examines in more detail how increasing the block
size for bus transactions decreases the total latency required and increases the max 
imum sustainable bandwidth. In Exercise 8.19, two different block sizes are con 
sidered (4 words and 16 words). Compute the total latency and the maximum
bandwidth for all of the possible block sizes (between 4 and 16) and plot your
results. Summarize what you learn by looking at your graph.
8.22 [15) <§8.5> This exercise is similar to Exercise 8.21. This time fix the block
size at 4 and 16 (as in Exercise 8.19), but compute latencies and bandwidths for
reads of different sizes. Specifically, consider reads of from 4 to 256 words, and use
as many data points as you need to construct a meaningful graph. Use your graph
to help determine at what point block sizes of 16 result in a reduced latency when
compared with block sizes of 4.
8.23 (10 ) <§8.S> This exercise examines a design alternative to the system
described in Exercise 8.18 that may improve the performance ofwrites. For writes,
assume all of the characteristics reported in Exercise 8.18 as well as the following:
The first 4 words are written 200 ns after the address is available, and each
new write takes 20 ns. Assume a bus transfer of the most recent data to
write, and a write of the previous 4 words can be overlapped.
The performance analysis reported in the exa mple would thus remain unchanged
for writes (in actuality, some minor changes might exist due to the need to com 
pute error correction codes, etc., but we'll ignore this). An alternative bus scheme
relies on separate 32-bit address and data lines. This will permit an address and
data to be transmitted in the same cycle. For this bus alternative, what will the
latency of the entire 256-word transfer be? What is the sustained bandwidth? Con 
sider block sizes of 4 and 8 words. When do you think the alternative scheme
would be heavily favored?
8.24 <20> <§8.5> Consider an asynchronous bus used to interface an I/O
device to the memory system described in Exercise 8.18. Each I/O request asks
for 16 words of data from the memory, which, along with the I/O device, has a
4-word bus. Assume the same type of handshaking protocol as appears in Figure
8.10 on page 584 except that it is extended so that the memory can continue the
