3.6 Floating Point 189
Summary
The common hardware support for multiply and divide allows MIPS to provide a
single pair of 32-bit registers that are used both for multiply and divide. Figure 3. 14
summarizes the additions to the MIPS architecture for the last two sections.
MIPS divide instructions ignore overflow, so software must determine if the quo  Hardware

events. MIPS software must check the divisor to discover division by 0 as well as
overflow.
Elaboration: An even faster algorithm does not immediately add the divisor back if
the remainder is negative. It simply adds the dividend to the shifted remainder in the
following step since (r + d) x 2 - d = r x 2 + d x 2 - d = r x 2 + d. This nonrestoring divi 
sion algorithm, which takes 1 clock per step, is explored further in Exercise 3.29; the
algorithm here is called restoring division.

American proverb
Going beyond signed and unsigned integers, programming languages support
numbers with fractions, which are called reals in mathematics. Here are some
examples of reaIs:
