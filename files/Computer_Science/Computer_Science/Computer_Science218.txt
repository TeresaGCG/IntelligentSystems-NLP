RoatingÂ·Point Multiplication
Now that we have explained floating-point addition, let's try floating-point multi 
plication. We start by multiplying decimal numbers in scientific notation by
5
10
hand: l.llOten X 10 X9.200 X 10- . Assume that we can store only four digits
ten
of the significand and two digits of the exponent.
Step I. Unlike addition, we calculate the exponent of the product by simply add 
ing the exponents of the opera nds together:
New exponent = 10 + (-5) = 5
Let's do this with the biased exponents as well to make sure we obtain the
same result: 10+ 127= 137,and -5+ 127= 122, so
New exponent = 137 + 122 = 259
This result is too large for the 8-bit exponent field, so something is amiss!
The problem is with the bias because we are adding the biases as well as
the exponents:
New exponent = (10+ 127) + (-5 +127)= (5 +2x 127) =259
Accordingly, to get the correct biased slim when we add biased nllmbers, we
mllst 5lIbtract the biasfrom the slim:
New exponent = 137 + 122- 127= 259- 127 = 132 = (5 + 127)
and 5 is indeed the exponent we calculated initially.
Step 2. Next comes the multiplication of the significands:
1.1 IOten
x 9.200
ten
0000
0000
2220
9990
102 12000
ten
There are three digits to the right of the decimal for each operand, so the
decimal point is placed six digits from the right in the product significand:
10.212000
ten
Assuming that we can keep only three digits to the right of the decimal
point, the product is 10.212 X 105.
