FIGURE 5.10 The datapath for the memory Instructions and the RÂ·type Instructions. ThIS example shows how
a single datapath can be assembled from the pieces in Figures 5.7 and 5.8 by adding multiplexors.l\I.u multiplexors are needed,
as described as in the example.
the datapath from R-type and memory instructions (Figure 5.10 on page 299),
and the datapath for branches (Figure 5.9 on page 297). Figure 5. 11 shows the
datapath we obtain by composing the separate pieces. The branch instruction uses
the main ALU for comparison of the register operands, so we must keep the
adder in Figure 5.9 for computing the branch target address. An additional mul 
tiplexor is required to select either the sequentially following instruction address
+
(PC 4) or the branch target address to be written into the Pc.
Now that we have completed this simple datapath, we can add the control unit.
The control unit must be able to take inputs and generate a write signal for each
state element, the selector control fo r each multiplexor, and the ALU control. The
ALU control is different in a number of ways, and it will be useful to design it first
before we design the rest of the control unit.
Which of the following is correct for a load instruction? Check
Yourself
a. MemtoReg should be set to cause the data from memory to be sent to the
register file.
b. MemtoReg should be set to cause the correct register destination to be sent
to the register file.
c. We do not care about the setting of MemtoReg.
