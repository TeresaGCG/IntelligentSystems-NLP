FIGURE 1.17 Performance Increase of workstations, 1987-2003. Here performance is given
as approximately the number of times faster than the VAX-II/780, which was a commonly used yardstick.
The rate of performance improvement is between 1.5 and 1.6 times per year. These performance numbers
are based on SPECint performance (see Chapter 2) and scaled over time to deal with changing benchmark
sets. For processors listed with xly after their name, x is the model nwnber andy is the speed in megahertz.
performance growth rate for the industry will yield machines with the same
performance. For example, assuming a 50% yearly growth rate in performance, a
3
machine with performance x today can be expected to have performance l.S x =
3.4x in three years. Your machine would have no performance advantage! Many
projects within computer companies are canceled, either because they ignore this
rule or because the project is completed late and the performance of the delayed
machine is below the industry average. This phenomenon may occur in any
industry, but rapid improvements in cost/performan ce make it a major concern in
the computer industry.
