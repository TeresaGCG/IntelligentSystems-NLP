7.3 [ IOJ <§7.2> Describe the general charJcteristics of:l program that would ex 
hibit very high amounts of temporal locality but very little spatial locality with re 
gard to data accesses. Provide an example program (pseudocode is fine).
7.4 [ IOJ <§7.2> Describe the general characteristics of a program that would ex 
hibit very little temporal locality but very high amounts of spatial locality with re 
ga rd to data accesses. Provide an example program (pseudocode is fine).
7.5 [3/3J <§7.2> A new processor can use either a write-through or write-back
cache selectable through softwa re.
Assume the processor will run data intensive applications with a large num

ber of load and store operations. Explain which cache write policy should be
used.
b. Consider the same question but this time for a safety critical system
III
which data integrity is more important than memory performance.

7.9 [ IOJ <§7.2> Here is a series of address references given as word addresses: 2,
3, 11 , 16,2 1, 13, 64, 48, 19, 11 , 3, 22, 4, 27, 6, and 11. Assuming a direct-mapped
cache with 16 one-word blocks that is initially empty, label each reference in the
list as a hit or a miss and show the final contents of the cache.
7.10 (10) <§7.2> Using the series of references given in Exercise 7.9, show the hits
and misses and fin al cache contents for a direct-mapped cache with four-word
blocks and a total size of 16 words.
7.11 (15) <§7.2> Given the following pseudocode:
int array[lOOOO , lOOOOO] ;
fo r each element array[i][j] (
array[i][j] array[i][j] *2;
=
I
write two C programs that implement this algorithm: one should access the ele 
ments of the array in row-major order, and the other should access them in col 
umn-major order. Compare the execution times of the two programs. \Vhat does
this tell you about the effects of memory layout on cache performance?
7.12 (10 ) <§7.2> Compute the total number of bits required to implement the
cache in Figure 7.9 on page 486. This number is different from the size of the
