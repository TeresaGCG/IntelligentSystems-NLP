4.2 CPU Performance and Its Factors 247
needed for a program and the length of each cycle. Many techniques that decrease
the number of clock cycles also increase the clock cycle time.
Improving Performance
Our favorite program runs in 10 seconds on computer A, which has a 4 GHz EXAMPLE
clock. We are trying to help a computer designer build a computer, B, that
will run this program in 6 seconds. The designer has determined that a sub 
stantial increase in the clock rate is possible, but this increase will affect the
rest of the CPU design, causing computer B to require 1.2 times as many
clock cycles as computer A for this program. \-Â¥hat clock rate should we tell
the designer to target?
Let's first find the number of clock cycles required for the program on A: ANSWER
CPU clock cycles
A
CPU time =
A Clock rate
A
CPU clock cycles
A
10 seconds =
4 X 109 cycles
second
,
109 cycles
CPU clock cycles = 10 seconds X4 X 40 X 10 cycles
A
second
CPU time for B can be found using this equation:
1.2 X CPU clock cycles
A
Clock rate
B
,
1.2 X 40 X 10 cycles
6 seconds
Clock rate
B
, ,
1.2 X40 X 10 9'cles = 8 X 10 cycles = 8 GHz
Clock rate =
B
6 seconds second
computer B must therefore have twice the clock rate of A to run the program
in 6 seconds.
