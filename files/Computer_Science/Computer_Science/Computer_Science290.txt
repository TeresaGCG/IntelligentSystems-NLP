274 Chapter 4 Assessing and Understanding Performance
C2 is produced by the makers of 12, and the other compiler is a third-party product.
Assume that each compiler uses the same number of instmctions for a given pro 
gram but that the instruction mix is as described in the table. Using C i on both II
and 12, how much faster can the makers of I1 claim II is compared to 12? Using C2,
how much faster can the makers of 12 claim that 12 is compared to I I? If you pur 
chase I I, which compiler would you use? If you purchased 12, which compiler would
you use? Which computer and compiler would you purcllase if all other criteria are
identical, including cost?
4.11 [5J <ยง4.2> Consider program P, which runs on a 1 GHz machine Min 10
seconds. An optimization is made to P, replacing all instances of multiplying a val 
ue by 4 (mult X, X,4) with two instructions that set x to x + x twice (add X,X; add
X,X). Call this new optimized program P'. The CPI of a multiply instruction is 4,
and the CPI of an add is 1. After recompiling, the program now runs in 9 seconds
on machine M. How many multiplies were replaced by the new compiler?
4.12 [5 <ยง4.2> Your company could speed up a Java program on their new com  
J
puter by adding hardware support for garbage collection. Garbage collection cur 
rently comprises 20% of the cycles of the program. You have two possible changes
to the machine. The first one would be to automatically handle garbage collection
in hardware. This causes an increase in cycle time by a factor of 1.2. The second
would be to provide for new hardware instructions to be added to the ISA that
could be used during garbage collection. This would halve the number of instruc 
tion needed for garbage collections but increase the cycle time by 1.1. Which of
these two options, if either, should you choose?
4.13 [5J <ยง4.2> For the following set of variables, identify all of the subsets that
can be used to calculate execution time. Each subset should be minimal; that is, it
should not contain any variable that is not needed.
{CPI, clock rate, cycle time, MIPS, number of instructions in program, number of
cycles in program}
4.14 [5 <ยง4.2> The table below shows the number of floating-point operations
J
executed in three different programs and the runtime for those programs on three
different computers:
Execution time In seconds
Floating-point
Program operations Computer A Computer B Computer C
9
Program 1 5x10 2 5 10
9
Program 2 20x10 20 20 20
9
Program 3 40x10 200 50 15
Which computer is fastest according to total execution time? How many times as
fast is it compared to the other two computers?
