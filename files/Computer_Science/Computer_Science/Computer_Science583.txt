FIGURE 8.1 A typical collection of I/O devices. The connectlons between the I/O deVICes, pro 
cessor, and memoryare usually called buses. Communication among the devices and the processor use both
interrupts and protocols on the bus, as we will see in this chapter. Figure 8.11 on p.1ge 585 shows the organi 
zation for a desktop Pc.
How we should assess I/O performance often depends on the application. In
some environments, we may care primarily about system throughput. In these
cases, I/O bandwidth will be most important. Even I/O bandwidth can be mea 
sured in two different ways:
1. How much data can we move through the system in a certain time?
2. How many I/O operations ca n we do per unit of time?
\Vhich performance measurement is best may depend on the environment. For
example, in many multimedia applications, most I/O requests are for long streams
of data, and transfer bandwidth is the important characteristic. In another
environment, we may wish to process a large number of small, unrelated accesses
to an I/O device. An example of such an environment might be a tax-processing
office of the National Income Tax Service (NITS). NITS mostly cares about pro 
cessing a large number of forms in a given time; each tax form is stored separately
and is fairly small. A system oriented toward large file transfer may be satisfactory,
but an I/O system that can support the simultaneous transfer of many small files
may be cheaper and faster for processing millions of tax forms.
