Chapter 8
In an asynchronous protocol, the control signals ReadReq and DataRdy are
asserted until the other party (the memory or the device) indicates that the
COIl 
trollines have been seen and the data lines have been read; this indication is made
by asserting the Ack line. This complete process is called handshaking. Figure 8.1 0
shows how such a protocol operates by depicting the steps in the communication.
Although much of the bandwidth of a bus is decided by the choice of a syn 
chronous or asynchronous protocol and the timing characteristics of the bus, sev 
eral other factors affect the bandwidth that can be attained by a single transfer.
The most important of these are the data bus width, and whether it supports
block transfers or it transfers a word at a time.

The steps in the protocol begin immediately after the device signals a request by raising ReadReq and
putting the address on the Data lines:
1. When memory sees the ReadReq line, it reads the address from the data bus and raises Ack to
indicate it has been seen.
2. I/O device sees the Ack line high and releases the ReadReq and data lines.
3. Memory sees that ReadReq is low and drops the Ack line to acknowledge the ReadReq signal.
4. This step starts when the memory has the data ready. It places the data from the read request on
the data lines and raises DataRdy.
5. The I/O device sees DataRdy, reads the data from the bus, and signals that it has the data by raising
Aok.
6. The memory sees the Ack signal, drops DataRdy, and releases the data lines.
7. Finally, the I/O device, seeing DataRdy go low, drops the Ack line, which indicates that the
transmission is completed.
A new bus transaction can now begin.
FIGURE 8.10 The asynchronous handshaking protocol consists of seven steps to read a
word from memory and receive It In an I/ O device. The signals in color are those asserted by the
I/O device, while the memory asserts the signals shown in black. The arrows label the seven steps and the
event that triggers each step. The symbol showing two lines (high and low) at the same time on the data
lines indicates that the data lines have valid data at this point. (The symbol indicates that the data is valid,
but the value is not known.)
