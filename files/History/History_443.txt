Earth-based telescopes. By contrast, the Hubble can see 
objects 60 times fainter than those visible with Earth-
based telescopes.
The first components for the International	Space	
Station were taken into orbit in 1998, and the station 
received its first crew on November 2, 2000, marking 
the first day a permanent human presence in space was 
achieved. The space station has grown and evolved 
into an unprecedented laboratory complex. Offering 
a microgravity environment that cannot be duplicated 
on Earth, the station furthers knowledge of science 
and of how the human body functions for extended 
periods of time in space. By the time the station had 
been operating for five years, 89 scientific investiga-
tions had been conducted. A complete characterization
