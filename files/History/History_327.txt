try. After serving three years on the Court of Appeals, 
Marshall  was  appointed  by  President  Lyndon  B. 
Johnson as solicitor general of the United States, the 
third-highest office in the Justice Department. Presi-
dent Johnson proceeded to nominate Marshall to the 
Supreme Court in 1967. Marshall’s nomination was 
confirmed in the Senate 69 to 11, and he was sworn in 
as the first African-American Supreme Court justice 
on October 2, 1967. Marshall served on the court for 
almost 24 years.
On the liberal Warren court, Marshall joined a 
majority in favor of civil rights for minorities and the 
expansion of rights for all citizens. Marshall focused his 
energy on negotiating unanimity among his fellow jus-
tices to increase the weight of the Warren Court’s rul-
ings. However, as the court grew more conservative in 
the 1970s and 1980s, Marshall became famous for his 
vehement minority dissents, arguing in favor of affirma-
tive action, due process, and First Amendment rights, 
and against the death penalty. 
Thurgood Marshall died of heart failure in Bethes-
da, Maryland, on January 24, 1993. His legacy as Mr. 
Civil Rights marked him in history alongside activists 
such as Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, Jr.
