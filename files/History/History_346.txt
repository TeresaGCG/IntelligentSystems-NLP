Namibia struggled to bring equality to its indig-

made up 87.5 percent of the population, with white 
Africans numbering 6 percent and people of mixed race 
making up 6.5 percent.
By law, all indigenous groups participate equally in 
decisions affecting their lands, cultures, traditions, and 
allocations of natural resources. However, Namibia’s 
indigenous citizens were unable to fully exercise these 
rights as a result of minimal access to education, limited 
economic opportunities under colonial rule, and their 
relative isolation. Virtually all of the country’s minori-
ties are represented in Parliament, in senior positions 
in the cabinet, and at other levels of government. The 
San, also known as Bushmen, are particularly disad-
vantaged. The government took numerous measures 
to end societal discrimination against the San. How-
