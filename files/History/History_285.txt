many enemies within the Soviet Union. Finally, in late 
1964, Khrushchev was removed from power by a con-
servative faction led by Leonid Brezhnev. His life was 
spared, perhaps a testament to the success of his political 
reforms, but Khrushchev spent the rest of his life under 
house arrest. He died in Moscow in September 1971.
