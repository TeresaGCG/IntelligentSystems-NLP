the 1960s, the U.S. trade advantages began to diminish. The oil shocks of the 1970s revealed U.S. 
energy dependency on foreign sources, while its aging industrial infrastructure made it difficult to 
compete with modern and more efficient manufacturers overseas. In addition to western Europe, 
Japan emerged as a major economic competitor, followed by the “little dragons,” namely South 
Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan, which also began to compete for international markets. Partly in 
response to lower labor costs, U.S. corporations began to move production facilities from union-pro-
tected plants in the United States to plants in those countries. At the same time the European Com-
mon Market, begun after World War II, evolved by the late 1990s into the European Union (EU), 
which included most of the nations of western Europe. The EU became a third major economic 
powerhouse, along with the United States and Japan.
The development and improvement of computers from the mid-1950s helped to revolutionize 
global trading and business. The computer revolution also made it possible for U.S. companies to 
outsource jobs to lower-cost English-speaking countries such as India or Ireland. The development 
of copiers in the 1970s and then faxes helped to facilitate trading and business transactions across 
vast distances. Late in the 20th century, the World Wide Web, satellites, and cell phones made busi-
ness and trade communications almost instantaneous. 
With the end of the cold war by the early 1990s, Western capitalist countries led by the United 
States moved to globalize and privatize the world’s economic system. The IMF and World Bank 
made economic restructuring conditions for aid and loans to poor countries in the Global South. 
Nations seeking loans also had to lower protective tariffs and open their markets to goods from the 
West. This increased trade of goods from the West but often led to the further impoverishment of 
already poor nations. 
The most important world trade organization was the World Trade Organization (WTO), which 
included most industrialized nations, although Russia and India had not been admitted as of 2007. 
Important regional trading organizations promoting free trade were established; they included the 
EU, North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Andean Group (AG), Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation (APEC), Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) in the former Soviet Union, and the 
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in the Middle East. There was also a standardization of “floating 
currencies,” but the continued strength of the dollar favored the United States, although the growth of 
European currency (the euro) emerged as a possible rival in the early 21st century.
Africa lagged behind the world economically. It remained a source for raw materials and some-
times was used as a dumping ground for both low-quality goods and waste products from the indus-
trialized countries. The gap between wealthy and poor nations continued to grow in the latter part 
of the 20th century despite economic conferences attended by leaders of wealthy nations that called 
for the refinancing of global debt, especially for poor nations in Africa. In the Millennium Summit in 
2000, rich nations promised assistance to help poor nations out of the cycle of poverty by increasing 
education and health care and eradicating hunger while fighting virulent diseases such as malaria 
and AIDS by working with poor nations. 
However, by 2006 much remained undone, while the rich continued to grow richer and the poor 
continued to eke out livings through trade in raw materials and inefficiently produced food prod-
ucts. Increasing populations continued to undermine economic growth in many nations, especially 
in Africa but also in some parts of Asia. However, by the early 21st century, India and China, both 
previously low-income nations, had emerged as new economic and manufacturing giants, exporting 
a wide range of goods around the world and accumulating trade surpluses. They were followed by 
Vietnam, Thailand, and Malaysia, which also enjoyed rapid economic growth. The United States, 
in particular, had a huge trade deficit with China. 
The 20th century was also marked by the globalization of Western culture. The United States 
led the way as American movie and television stars, music, fashion, and even advertising became 
increasingly popular around the world. However, film industries in Egypt and Mumbai (Bombay), 
India, known as Bollywood (three times larger than Hollywood production), also enjoyed great 
popularity for audiences in the Middle East and Asia. Beginning in the 1980s, color television, sat-
