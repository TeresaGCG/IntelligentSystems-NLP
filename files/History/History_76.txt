painting saw a return to the styles of the 17th and 
18th centuries, in trying to create the look of a photo-

This involved adapting the modernist ideas, and often 
incorporated some elements of popular culture, and 
even performance art, into newer designs or incorpo-
rating new material.
ARCHITECTURE

construction of many war memorials and the paint-
ing  of  artwork  commemorating  sacrifice  in  war. 
Gradually this gave way to civil engineering projects 
for  Olympic  and  other  sporting  occasions  and  also 
many  ambitious  airport  complexes.  Architects  were 
also involved in designing large bridges, such as those 
over  the  Bosphorus  (Turkey),  the  Tagus  (Portugal),  
the Humber Bridge (UK), and from the Malaysian main-
land to Penang Island. There has also been the construc-
