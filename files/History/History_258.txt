helped to orchestrate a countercoup that kept Shah 
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in power. Iran, under the 
shah, was closely allied with the United States and in 
the cold war Iran was a staunchly pro-Western buf-
fer on the southern flank of the Soviet Union. Iran was 
used as a base for United States military and intelligence 
gathering aimed at the Soviet Union. The United States 
also supplied considerable assistance to the shah.
In 1961 the shah announced an ambitious plan of 
development known as the White Revolution. The six-
point plan included improvements in women’s rights, 
healthcare, and education, as well as privatization of 
state-owned factories and land reform. The proposed 
nationalization of land owned by the clergy and landed 
elites led to major demonstrations against the govern-
ment. The shah repressed all political opposition, and 
his secret police, SAVAK, imprisoned and often tortured 
opponents of the regime, especially members of the Ira-
nian communist Tudeh Party.
