to remain in the United States without authorization, in 
1954 the U.S. government launched “Operation Wet-
back,” a program intended to repatriate unauthorized 
Mexicans, which also resulted in the deportation of 
some U.S. citizens. By the mid-1950s such repatriations 
reached a high of 3.8 million.
The Bracero Program is the subject of an expansive 
literature. The most rigorous early scholarly investigation 
was by the Mexican-American scholar and activist Dr. 
Ernesto Galarza, whose book Merchants	of	Labor (1964) 
is considered a classic in the field. Testifying repeatedly 
before the U.S. Congress and other government bodies, 
Galarza and others finally persuaded lawmakers to end 
the program. The program’s termination coincided with 
the rise of the National Farmworkers Association (later 
United Farmworkers of America, UFW), led by labor 
organizer Cesar Chavez. In many ways, the ending of the
