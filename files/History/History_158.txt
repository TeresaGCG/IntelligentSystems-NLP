Darfur
In 1989 a civil war began in the African nation of 
Sudan after an officer in the Sudanese army, Omar al-
Bashir, seized power through a coup d’état. The roots 
of this war are complex, including struggle over limited 
resources following a serious drought and famine in the 
mid-1980s, conflicting conceptions of the use of land, 
ethnic tensions between southern and northern peoples, 
and religious tensions between Muslims and non-Mus-
lims. In addition, in a more recent development, the 
cultivation of oil fields in southern Sudan led the gov-
ernment to engage in widespread destruction of long-
standing villages to profit from the production and sale 
of oil. Throughout the entire process the government 
used food and resources as weapons, often pitting dif-
ferent ethnic groups against each other and withholding 
humanitarian aid to force the population to abide by its
