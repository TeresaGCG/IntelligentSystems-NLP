porters that managed to ally itself with Southern con-
servatives led by Strom Thurmond of South Carolina. 
Nixon promised to name a Southerner to the Supreme 
Court, oppose court-ordered “busing” urged by the civil

tial candidate who would have Southern support. His 
choice was Maryland governor Spiro Agnew. Nixon 
stood against a disunited Democratic Party, which was 
split  between  supporters  of  Eugene  McCarthy  and 
Robert Kennedy who opposed the Vietnam War, and 
Hubert Humphrey, choice of the mainstream Democrat-

Humphrey being chosen as the candidate after a torrid 
party gathering at Chicago which led to fighting in the 
streets. Nixon promised that he would get “peace with 
honor” in Vietnam but was not specific about how he 
was going to achieve this. It did not stop him criticizing
