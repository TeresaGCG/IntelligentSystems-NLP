be going in a far different direction than Twain, but the 
two had more in common than sharing a stage. Twain 
reached pop and rock audiences with a blend of lyrics 
and style that crossed both those boundaries. Krauss 
built her foundation on traditional bluegrass and con-

versions of pop and rock songs they would likely not 
have encountered. 
It is a characteristic that has marked all the artists 
who have been involved in the fusion of country music 
and rock: a musical imagination that can see and hear 
beyond borders, and an understanding of what can be 
changed and what can remain the same, where the heart 
of the music lies. The period since 1950 has seen a mas-
sive increase in popular music, or “Pop Music,” as it has 
come to be known. The earliest type was probably the 
blues, evolving from African-American traditions and 
gaining popularity in the United States during the 1930s, 
with jazz taking over as an art form characterized by blue 
notes and improvisation. By the 1950s, records of jazz 
music were sold throughout the world. Jazz musicians 
from 1950 include many who played from the 1920s 
and 1930s: Louis Armstrong (1901–71), Count Basie 
(1904–84),  and  Duke  Ellington  (1899–1974).  There 
have also been a number of major political figures who 
have played jazz in public, including Prince Norodom 
Sihanouk of Cambodia, King Rama IX (Bhumibol) of 
Thailand, and former U.S. president Bill Clinton.
