The first AFL-CIO convention elected Meany as pres-
ident. In 1957 it enacted anti-racket codes and expelled 
the Teamsters Union for failure to meet ethical standards. 
In 1961 the AFL-CIO implemented mandatory arbitra-
tion of internal disputes. That failed to prevent a dust-up 
between Meany and Reuther, who regarded Meany as 
dictatorial and wanted the AFL-CIO to involve itself in 
civil rights and social welfare issues. Reuther wanted to 
be president of the AFL-CIO and felt that Meany had 
outlived his usefulness.
Reuther’s United Automobile Workers (UAW) left 
the AFL-CIO in 1968. In 1969 the UAW and the Team-
sters formed the Alliance for Labor Action (ALA), which 
sought to organize the unorganized, students, and intel-
lectuals. Reuther died in a plane crash in 1970. Without
