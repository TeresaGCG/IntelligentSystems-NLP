After  Li’s  departure  for  New  York,  Chiang 
resumed the presidency in Taiwan. Li refused to join 
the Nationalists on Taiwan and was impeached in 
absentia. The United States became an outspoken 
critic of Chiang’s rule. Li remained in the United 
States  until  1966,  when  he  returned  to  mainland 
China and voiced support of the Communist govern-
ment. He died shortly afterward.
