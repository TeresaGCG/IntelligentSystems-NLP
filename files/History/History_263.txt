Islamist	movements
Islamist movements flourished in many parts of the 
Muslim world in the late 20th century. These move-
ments sought to revitalize Islam as a political force 
and to create Islamic governments that would rule 
under sharia (Islamic law). Islam is the world’s second- 
largest religion, with 1.3 billion adherents, compared 
to Christianity, with 2.2 billion. It is the fastest-grow-
ing religion in Africa. The most predominantly Mus-
lim states are in Africa and Asia, but substantial num-
bers of Muslims also live in the Western Hemisphere 
and Europe. With 57 member states, the Organiza-
tion of Islamic Conference (OIC) was established in 
1969 to represent Muslim interests.
