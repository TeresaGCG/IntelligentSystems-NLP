control over a small enclave and several offshore islands 
that they hold until the present day. In 1959 Tangier lost 
its special status and was integrated into Morocco as a 
free port. 
Although the Istiqlal remained a key force in the 
Cabinet, Muhammad V had widespread governmental 
authority and enjoyed popular support as well as reli-
gious respect based on baraka, or good fortune. After 
his death in 1962, his son succeeded as King Hassan II. 
Hassan instituted a new constitution in 1962 but con-
tinued to exercise wide executive powers. The Istiqlal 
split in 1959, and a new group, the Union Nationale 
des Forces Populaire (UNFP), supported by Ben Barka, 
emerged. Following increased political opposition, Has-
san proclaimed a state of emergency with full legisla-
tive and executive powers in 1965. Ben Barka went into 
exile in France, where he was kidnapped and presum-
ably killed with the complicity of the Moroccan gov-
ernment in 1965. Political demonstrations against the 
regime continued in major cities throughout Morocco 
in the late 1960s, but Hassan remained in power owing 
to a combination of loyal courtiers, army officers, and 
security police.
In 1971 armed cadets stormed the royal palace dur-
ing Hassan’s birthday party, but when they failed to kill 
the king the attempted coup collapsed. In 1972 Hassan 
survived an airplane attack orchestrated by the former-
ly loyal general Mohammad Oufkir. The coup plotters, 
including Oufkir, were killed or imprisoned. In spite of 
ongoing charges of corruption and nepotism, Hassan 
remained in power.
