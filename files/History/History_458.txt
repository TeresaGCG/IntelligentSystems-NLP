life. She felt called to establish a religious community, 
the Missionaries of Charity sisters, dedicated to the ser-
vice of the poorest of the poor. Nearly two years passed 
in discernment before Mother Teresa received permis-

first time in a white, blue-bordered sari and left Loretto 
to enter the world of the poor. On December 21 she 
went for the first time to the slums to find and serve

After some months she was joined by a number of her 
former students.
On October 7, 1950, the new congregation of the 
Missionaries of Charity was officially established in Cal-
cutta. By the early 1960s Mother Teresa began to send 
her sisters to other parts of India. In February 1965 she 
opened a house in Venezuela. It was soon followed by 
foundations in Rome and Tanzania and, eventually, on 
every continent. During the years of rapid growth the 
world began to focus its attention on Mother Teresa. 
Numerous awards honored her work. An increasingly 
interested media began to follow her activities. Her 
humble stature and effective work also attracted the 
attention of many intellectuals and celebrities, many of 
whom were touched by her spirit.

ing, the dignity of every human person, the value of little 
things done faithfully, and the surpassing worth of faith 
in God. But only after her death was it revealed that her
