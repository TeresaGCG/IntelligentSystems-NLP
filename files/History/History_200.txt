Gandhi,	Indira	
(1917–1984) Indian	prime	minister
Indira Priyadarshini Gandhi (November 19, 1917–Octo-
ber 31, 1984) was the third (1966–77) and sixth (1980–
84) prime minister of India and the first woman to hold 
that office. Her legacy is very complex.
Gandhi was the daughter of the first prime minister 
of India, Jawaharlal Nehru (1889–1964). She was a 
member of the Indian National Congress, a national-
ist organization established during British rule in 1885. 
In the 1930s Gandhi began the Vanara Sena, a move-
ment that consisted of young people who participated 
in marches and protests to support the independence 
movement and also distributed nationalist propaganda 
and illegal materials.
While attending Oxford University, Gandhi met a 
young Parsee activist and Congress Party member, Fero-
ze Gandhi (1912–60). The two eventually returned to 
India and were married in 1942. They had two sons, 
Rajiv (1944–91) and Sanjay (1946–80). Shortly after 
their marriage she and Feroze joined Mohandas Gan-
dhi’s (1869–1948) nonviolent action against the British, 
which landed them in jail. Shortly after independence
