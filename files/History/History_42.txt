and created new “hot spots” around the globe. As old-style colonialism collapsed, especially after 
1960, new wars over boundaries and resources erupted in Africa and other formerly colonized 
regions where Western control had distorted national development. Tribal massacres in Rwanda 
and the Darfur region of Sudan were only the bloodiest outcomes of warfare also afflicting Congo, 
Liberia, and much of West Africa. “Ethnic cleansing” occurred in Europe, as Yugoslavia, once an 
independent socialist state, broke into warring religious and ethnic groups. India and Pakistan 
clashed over the disputed territory of Kashmir, becoming competing nuclear powers in the pro-
cess. Persistent conflict between Israel, founded in 1948 as a Jewish state, and its Arab neighbors 
remained a major danger to world peace. 
Indeed, events in the oil-rich Middle East became even more central in the post–cold war years. 
Religious conflicts between some Islamist organizations and other world religions were at the heart 
of warfare conducted not by national armies but by small, dedicated groups using terrorist tactics, 
including suicide bombing, to achieve their aims. Terrorism was not a new method of warfare—
Irish nationalists for years had used terror tactics against Britain—but it seemed especially effective 
against nations whose strength lay in conventional methods of warfare. 
Russian troops laid waste to the separatist Islamic region of Chechnya, but found that this nei-
ther ended Chechen guerrilla actions nor protected Russian civilians from terror attacks, even in 
Moscow. On September 11, 2001, al-Qaeda, an Islamist group based in Afghanistan, used 19 oper-
atives, armed only with box cutters and just enough training to pilot commercial jets, to bring down 
New York City’s World Trade Center and seriously damage the Pentagon outside Washington, D.C. 
Smaller deadly attacks in Madrid and London were later perpetrated by al-Qaeda or similar non-
national terrorist groups. The U.S.-led 2003 Second Gulf War against Saddam Hussein’s regime in 
Iraq in 2003 was a triumph for America’s sophisticated weapons but faltered amid low-tech attacks 
committed by warring factions upon each other and U.S. forces.
As the 21st century got under way, the rapid spread of technology and almost uncontrolled sales 
of arms and possible “weaponized” biological and chemical agents seemed to be changing warfare 
from nation-state projections of power within formal rules of engagement into a dangerous free-for-all 
among disgruntled nations, regions, and even small groups of individuals destabilizing the world.
