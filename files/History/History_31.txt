FOOD PRODUCTION
Between 1950 and 2000 the world population increased from about 2.5 billion to over 6 billion 
people. Throughout this era food shortages and malnutrition persisted in parts of eastern and southern 
Asia, Central and South America, and throughout sub-Saharan Africa. Famines were caused by human 
factors such as war, civil strife, and failed economic and political policies, while sometimes being exac-
erbated by natural disasters such as drought. In the 1970s an almost decade-long drought in the Sahel 
region of Africa south of the Sahara contributed to the death of millions. Hundreds of thousands of 
others left their homes, walking long distances to neighboring countries in search of food. These refu-
gees then became dependent on subsistence aid from governments or relief agencies.
In the early 21st century, a peanut-based paste (Plumpy’nut), developed by a French scientist, 
André Briend, offered high nutritional value at very low cost and seemed a promising means of 
alleviating severe malnutrition among children in Africa. A human-made famine caused by the com-
munist regime under Mao Zedong resulted in the deaths of 27 million people in China from 1958 
to 1960. The reversal of Mao’s agricultural policies in the 1980s under Deng Xiaoping increased 
agricultural production by 50 percent in only eight years. Inefficiencies and waste on collective 
farms also resulted in food shortages in the Soviet Union.
In the Middle East, some oil-rich nations such as Libya and Saudi Arabia devoted huge amounts 
of money to subsidize agricultural and livestock production in order to avoid total dependence 
on food imports. Vast agricultural projects, some using hydroponics (growth in water), irrigation, 
and other techniques increased production but were not cost-effective. Nations in the region with 
large populations and little oil, such as Egypt, were unable to adopt such expensive technologies to 
increase productivity.
Subsistence production in Central and South America declined as commercial agriculture 
grew; rural producers everywhere became increasingly linked to national and international mar-
kets. Overall, imports of food increased as the 20th century progressed. United States foreign 
aid was often tied to the acceptance of U.S. food imports that sought to dump excess production
