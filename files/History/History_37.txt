to plant in public and private lands in exchange for small remuneration and won the 2004 Nobel 
Peace Prize. Muslim women feminists Fatima Mernissi of Morocco and Shirin Ebadi of Iran (the 2003 
Nobel Peace Prize winner) both wrote about rights of Muslim women; their work provided liberal 
interpretations of Islamic tradition and law and promoted feminism as part of Islam. Nawal al Sad-
dawi of Egypt and others also spoke out against crimes of honor and physical domestic abuse, which 
is a global problem. The Gameen Bank, begun by the economist Mohammad Yunus from Bangla-
desh, has made hundreds of thousands of microloans to women to empower them economically. This 
model has been copied in several countries, and Yunus was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006.
Women have been elected as president or prime minister in Great Britain, Germany, Turkey, 
Pakistan, India, and a host of other nations. In 2006, Michelle Bachelet was elected as president of 
Chile, and Ellen Johnson Sirleaf as president in Liberia—nations whose political systems had previ-
ously been dominated by men. 
The populations of Western countries, Japan, and even China also became older as life spans 
extended, owing to better health care, lowering of birth rates, and new treatments for a host of 
physical problems. Japanese men and women enjoyed the longest life span worldwide. In contrast, 
from the 1970s on, many in Africa were condemned to early deaths that were, in part, caused by 
poverty, high infant mortality, and disease, especially HIV and AIDS. In Africa over a dozen nations 
had higher under-five infant mortality rates in 2006 than in 1990, and India had one of the highest 
numbers per capita of maternal deaths per year. The rights of children also continued to be imperiled 
in many poor nations, where they often had to work in dangerous conditions in order to provide 
food for their families. To ameliorate such abuses, the United Nations launched campaigns against 
child exploitation, while international nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) such as the Bill and 
Melinda Gates Foundation in the United States devoted vast sums of money to address problems of 
international public health, especially such diseases as polio and AIDS. 
In the 1960s, university students led a young people’s movement in the West that challenged 
old traditions in social behavior, fashion, music, and politics. The hippies of the era advocated a 
lifestyle of “making love not war” and urged their peers to “drop out and tune in” with drugs, 
rock and roll music, and sex. The civil rights movement in the 1950s and 1960s in the United 
States struggled to achieve equal rights for African Americans, long a social and economic under-
class. Martin Luther King, Jr., led a nonviolent struggle against segregation and helped to achieve 
more equal political and legal rights. But riots and protests, coupled with mounting opposition to 
U.S. involvement in the war in Vietnam, polarized American society. King and other leaders were 
assassinated, and protesting students at Kent State University in Ohio were shot by the National 
Guard in the 1960s. 
Blacks in South Africa also waged a protracted struggle against the apartheid system of total 
racial segregation. The African National Congress (ANC) led by Nelson Mandela ultimately resort-
ed to violence to dismantle apartheid; it finally gained full political and social rights in 1990s. Indig-
enous peoples in Latin and South America and Canada, Australia, and New Zealand also sought 
and often gained improved rights and status. Rigoberta Menchú was awarded the 1992 Nobel Prize 
for Peace for her struggle for the rights of indigenous peoples in the Western Hemisphere. Because 
inequities continued to exist, the struggles for social and class equality appeared certain to continue 
well into the 21st century.
TRADE AND CULTURAL ExCHANGES
World War II provided full employment and production to the U.S. economy, which allowed it to 
dominate world trade and industry in the war’s immediate aftermath. In contrast, the infrastructures 
of all of the other major manufacturing nations in Europe and Japan had been largely destroyed by 
the war. 
These factors allowed U.S.-based corporations to enjoy an almost total monopoly in the manu-
facturing of steel, automobiles, and a host of other consumer goods for the domestic and interna-
tional markets in the 1950s. However, as Europe and Japan recovered from the effects of the war in
