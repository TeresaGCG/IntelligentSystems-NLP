	 Kennedy,	John	F.
Kennedy was interested in rapprochement with the 
Soviet Union, but he had to be perceived as “tough,” 
especially in Europe. On June 26, 1963, he visited West 
Berlin and addressed a large public crowd with the 
famous “Ich bin ein Berliner” speech. In August 1963 
Kennedy was able to sign into law the Nuclear Test Ban 
Treaty, which prohibited atomic testing on the ground, 
in the atmosphere, and underwater, but did not pro-
hibit testing underground.
Another foreign policy problem that Kennedy faced 
was the increased fighting in Laos and Vietnam. In 
the former, the Kennedy administration backed a neu-
tral government, and in the latter, the United States was 
heavily involved in supporting the anticommunist South 
Vietnamese government led by President Ngo Dinh 
Diem. By 1963 there were 15,000 U.S. military advisers
