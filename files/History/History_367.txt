Olympics	(1950–present)
One of the goals of Baron Pierre de Coubertin—found-
er of the modern Olympic Games and organizer of the 
first modern games in 1896—was to encourage inter-
national  understanding  through  sports,  and  help  to 
create a more peaceful world. But after 50 years and 
two world wars—the bloodiest and most violent wars 
the world had yet seen—the Olympic dream of de Cou-
bertin seemed very distant indeed. Too often the compe-
tition between nations would overshadow the competi-
tion of the athletes, and occasionally even the athletes 
themselves would be the center of controversy.
In fact the Olympic Games found themselves, in 
1948, in the middle of the geopolitics of the cold war. 
The world found itself poised on the brink of nuclear 
confrontation between the United States and the Soviet 
Union, and it seemed the world needed the Olympic 
Games and de Coubertin’s vision of peace now more 
than ever. Often, however, the Games would be just 
another proxy in the ideological battle between liberal 
democracy and communism.
One of the most famous incidents of the 1956 Mel-
bourne Games was the water polo match between the 
Soviet Union and Hungary. This match followed the 
Soviet quashing of the Hungarian uprising; because of 
political tension between the countries, the match was 
contested with such intensity that blood was seen in the 
swimming pool.
But in addition to political theater, the games also  Towering	over	the	city,	the	Olympic	Stadium	in	Montreal,	Canada,	
provided many moments of genuine human drama,  was	built	for	the	1976	Summer	Olympics.
