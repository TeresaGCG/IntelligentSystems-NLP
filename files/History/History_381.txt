Expectedly, Marcos declared himself the winner. 
But  the  People  Power  nonviolent  revolution  would 
eventually triumph by the defection of two men in 
Marcos’s camp: the civilian defense minister and a high- 
ranking general of the armed forces. They were sup-
ported by the archbishop of Manila, Cardinal Jaime 
Sin, who called on Filipino civilians for help. At first a 
trickle, then hundreds of thousands of ordinary Filipi-
nos from all economic strata responded, converging on 
the streets with no weapons, calling on the advancing 
soldiers and marines to join the protest. 
FIRST WOMAN PRESIDENT
Within  four  days,  the  number  of  defecting  soldiers 
made it clear that Marcos no longer controlled the 
military. The United States asked Marcos to step down 
from power and to desist from military action. Fear-
ing for their lives, Marcos and his family were flown 
out of the country and took refuge in Hawaii. Corazon 
Aquino was inaugurated as president on that day, the 
first woman president of the Philippines.
The popular and nonviolent People Power revolution 
of 1986 restored democracy, but it did not solve all the 
problems of the country. Twenty years later, the country 
still faces many political, economic, and social ills. But 
what People Power demonstrated was the moral superi-
ority of nonviolent and prayerful resistance to political 
tyranny and moral evil.
