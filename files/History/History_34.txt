to the Moon, Mars, and other planets have also resulted in new information and recategorizations 
of planets and other heavenly bodies. 
Energy. Finding sufficient energy for a growing and industrializing world population proved 
to be a major challenge. Soon after the United States dropped its two atomic bombs in 1945, 
some physicists and business interests began to promote peaceful uses of atomic energy. Although 
hundreds of nuclear-fueled power plants are operating around the world, especially in Japan and 
Europe, an atomic age of abundant clean energy did not come to pass in the 20th century. 
Nuclear energy’s beginning as a fearful weapon that caused not only instant deaths but lingering 
radiation sickness did not help its image. Nor did the United States’s development of an even more 
destructive hydrogen bomb. In 1963, the United States and Soviet Union acknowledged some of 
these concerns, signing a treaty that required weapons tests underground to minimize atmospheric 
contamination 
Electric utilities using fossil fuels—coal and petroleum—produce greater air pollution than 
nuclear power plants, but they enjoyed several advantages. Less heavily regulated, they also did 
not need to store or process radioactive waste that could last for thousands of years, as spent plu-
tonium fuel did. Nuclear plants also required constant cooling. Cooling water inevitably got hot 
as it circulated through reactors. Although this water was not radioactive, it could cause thermal 
pollution if dumped into local rivers and was implicated in the deaths of fish and other aquatic life. 
By the 1960s, ecologists were describing these adverse effects and enthusiasm for nuclear plants was 
waning. A near disaster at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania in 1979, followed in 1986 by a reac-
tor meltdown in Chernobyl, Ukraine, that spread high levels of radiation across much of western 
Europe, brought new nuclear projects almost to a halt.
Late in the century, evidence of global warming mounted as ice sheets in the Arctic and Ant-
arctic began melting rapidly. Carbon dioxide levels climbed, and the protective ozone layer shrank. 
Although Earth had experienced cycles of abnormal warmth and cold even before humans appeared, 
most scientists and some political leaders feared that human activity was seriously disrupting the 
world’s climate. They urged energy conservation and alternatives to carbon-rich oil and coal, such 
as solar and wind power, hydrogen, and synthetic fuels. In 2005, 140 nations ratified the Kyoto Pro-
tocols, designed to limit destructive emissions. The United States, proportionally the world’s largest 
energy user, declined to sign the treaty.
Chemistry and Material Science. New synthetics enabled the construction of cheaper, better-
insulated houses, taller office buildings, and safer roads and bridges. Plastics, along with resins and 
epoxy, came into their own in the 1950s, usually replacing traditional natural materials. From no-
iron polyester clothing to nonstick cookware, from fireproofing to mold-proofing, companies like 
Monsanto, BASF, and DuPont promised “better living through chemistry.” Pharmaceutical chem-
ists, like Germany’s Bayer, engineered new medicines and made them easier to use. Agricultural 
pesticides significantly improved crop yields.
But side effects rose in tandem with chemistry’s proliferating consumer and industrial applica-
tions. Nearly indestructible, plastics soon glutted landfills. In 1962, scientist Rachel Carson blamed 
DDT, a powerful insecticide formulated by Swiss scientists in the 1930s, for bird deaths. At Love 
Canal in Niagara Falls, New York, industrial wastes left behind by a chemical company were blamed 
in 1978 for illnesses affecting both adults and children, whose school was built atop a toxic dump. 
In the Indian industrial city Bhopal in 1984, a Union Carbide plant leaked the pesticide methyl iso-
cyanate, exposing 500,000 people to sickening fumes and killing thousands. The Bhopal area was 
still contaminated 20 years later.
The Information Age. ENIAC, the first electronic computer, was completed in 1945 at the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania under a military contract. Engineer J. Presper Eckert and physicist John W. 
Mauchly’s enormous device was powered by 18,000 vacuum tubes and performed 5,000 calcula-
tions per second. Hungarian refugee John von Neumann soon after developed what became the 
basic architecture of computer systems. The invention of transistors by lab scientists at Bell Labo-
ratories in 1948 eventually eliminated clumsy vacuum tubes and paved the way for microchips that
