would make computers and many other digital devices much smaller, cheaper, and more powerful. 
While computers allegedly reduced paper documents, new copying and printing technologies only 
increased the flood. The process that would eventually be trademarked by the Xerox Corporation 
was invented in 1938 but did not become commercially viable until the 1960s. As computers found 
ways to “talk” to each other, old-line consumer businesses like Corning Glass became suppliers of 
fiber-optic technology, carrying millions of data and voice messages around the world. 
New opportunities for instant worldwide communication proved to be both a promise and a 
threat. Despite unequal access across national and class lines, these devices were readily adapted in 
most societies. It seemed that the Internet might do to printed books and newspapers what automo-
biles had done to railroads.
Human Engineering. Deoxyribonucleic acid—DNA—might be the most important biological 
breakthrough in human history. Identified and decoded in 1953 by researchers James Watson, Fran-
cis Crick, Maurice Wilkins, and Rosalind Franklin, this double helix composed of four protein 
building blocks has been used to identify criminals, trace ancestors, and pinpoint disease processes. 
The Human Genome was “mapped” in 2000 by multinational efforts involving both university 
geneticists and commercial DNA scientists. DNA holds out the promise of eradicating genetic dis-
eases but has also raised troubling ethical issues of privacy, eugenics, and equality of medical care. 
New reproductive technologies are especially controversial. In Britain in 1978, the first healthy 
“test tube” baby was born after her father’s sperm and mother’s eggs were mixed by physicians 
in a laboratory. In vitro fertilization, as it is now called, became a relatively routine technique for 
couples struggling with infertility. Controversy grew as some fertilization techniques produced mul-
tiple births, and a few women past menopause used medical techniques to carry babies to term. So-
called boutique babies also raised ethical questions. At least theoretically, parents could choose their 
child’s sex or sexual orientation, their height and looks, or their IQ and mental proclivities. Some 
ethicists are disturbed by these developments, seeing them as a form of prenatal eugenics.
In 1955 doctors Jonas Salk and Albert Sabin independently developed vaccines to end polio, 
a waterborne viral disease that crippled or killed. Franklin D. Roosevelt, who contracted polio in 
1920, was America’s most famous victim of the prevaccine disease. A few years later, smallpox was 
declared eradicated. For a while, it looked as though medical advances would soon end most human 
disease. New drugs, including medications for mental illnesses, indeed prolonged and improved 
lifespans. But access to medical care was extremely inequitable, even in wealthy nations like the 
United States, and more so in less-developed societies. America’s “War on Cancer” made progress 
but found few certain cures. The shocking emergence in the 1980s of previously unknown diseases 
—particularly HIV/AIDS—convincingly showed that human scientific knowledge had not yet cre-
ated a perfect world.
SOCIAL AND CLASS RELATIONS
Major social and class changes occurred around the world in the post–World War II era. In the 
United States, the GI Bill enabled hundreds of thousands of young veterans to attend university, 
thereby opening up white-collar and professional jobs for an entire generation of working class or 
rural youth. After the war, there was also a huge baby boom in the United States, Europe, and Aus-
tralasia. In the United States, many families moved from agricultural or urban areas to the suburbs, 
often buying new homes with loans provided for veterans. Road systems, shopping malls, schools, 
and hospitals were constructed to provide services for these new residents. The same trends were 
followed by the peoples in western Europe, Canada, and Australia.
In Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, many young people and families flocked to the cities to find 
work and better ways of life. Urbanization became a global phenomenon in the last half of the 20th 
century. By 2006 more than 8 million Chinese peasants annually were moving into cities to find 
work. Whereas Great Britain had five cities of over a million people, China by 2000 had 90. In Cen-
tral and South America, where social and class relations were most starkly contrasted, urban popu-
lations swelled and vast slums sprang up in major cities like São Paulo, Bogotá, and Lima. Similarly
