Not all scientists accept the global warming hypoth-
esis,  however.  Alternative  explanations  include  the 
argument that the increase in temperature has not been 
clearly established, that it is within the range of normal 
variation to be expected over time, or that it is due to the 
period when measurement began having been unusually 
cold. Others argue that although the global temperature 
does seem to be rising, there is no proof that the rise in 
temperature was caused by human activity.
