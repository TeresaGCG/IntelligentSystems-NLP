	 Bhutto,	Zulfikar	 
With Zia’s death in August 1988, elections were 
held and Bhutto ran for prime minister. The PPP was 
unable to win a majority of the seats in parliament, but 
did put together a coalition government with Bhutto 
as the prime minister. Bhutto and the PPP worked to 
improve the conditions of the poor of Pakistan as well 
as to improve social justice in the country. She also 
believed in a free economy and private control of busi-
ness. She worked to improve human rights in Pakistan.
Throughout Bhutto’s term, the opposition tried to 
get her removed from office. Their attempts had been 
unsuccessful until 1990 when violence broke out in 
several cities in Pakistan. This violence, along with 
support from the military, gave the Pakistani presi-
dent the excuse he needed to dismiss the government. 
Thus on August 6, 1990, Bhutto was removed from 
office and charged with corruption, nepotism, and 
misuse of her office. In elections in October the PPP 
lost all but a few of the seats it held in parliament.
Bhutto spent the next several years improving her 
reputation. The government that replaced her coalition 
proved unable to deal with the problems of Pakistan and 
new elections were held in 1993. The PPP, while holding 
a large number of seats, did not have a majority. When 
a PPP candidate was elected president, it appeared that 
the government would be stable. However, corruption 
and criminal activity by politicians continued to be a 
problem. She was dismissed as prime minister in 1996 
and went into exile. Bhutto vowed she would triumph 
in new elections scheduled for February 1997, but she
