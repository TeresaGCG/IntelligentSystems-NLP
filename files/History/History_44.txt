	 Afghanistan
In the early 1960s Daoud, obsessed with Pashtun 
unification, made payments to tribesmen on both sides 
of the border and spread propaganda. In 1960 he sent 
troops across the border. As a result the two countries 
severed relations in September 1961 and the border 
was closed to even nomadic sheepherders. In 1963 as 
it became clear that an extended showdown with Paki-
stan would only hurt Afghanistan, King Zahir Shah dis-
missed Daoud and took direct control of the country.
The king ruled from 1963 to 1973. Within two 
months of taking power he had reached an agreement 
reestablishing diplomatic and trade relations with Paki-
stan. He also began an experiment in liberalization 
called “new democracy.” At the center of this was a 
new constitution, promulgated in 1964. It barred the 
royal family—except the king—from politics, created a 
partyless system of elections, extended full citizenship 
to all residents of the country, including non-Pashtuns, 
and created a secular parliament and an independent 
judiciary. Although Afghanis voted in elections in 1965 
and 1969, the king held most of the power.
After a decade of economic stagnation and politi-
cal instability, the king was deposed while in Europe in 
1973 by Mohammed Daoud. The economy continued 
to stagnate and Daoud could only maintain stability 
through repression. In April 1978 a communist coup 
forced Daoud from power.
