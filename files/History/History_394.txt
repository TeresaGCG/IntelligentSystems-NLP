1974, Qaddafi proclaimed that Libya was to be known 
as the Socialist People’s Libyan Arab Jamahariya. He 
subsequently stepped down from all public offices but 
remained the real ruler of Libya from behind the scenes.
In 1975, Qaddafi published the first of three docu-
ments called The	Green	Book, which expounded his 
personal philosophy and political belief translated into 
a program of action. The	Green	Book became part of 
every Libyan’s life and was studied in schools; extracts 
were broadcast daily, and its slogans were publicized 
throughout the nation. Part one of the book, The	Solu-
tion	of	the	Problem	of	Democracy—The	Authority	of	
the	People,	concentrated on the political structure	of 
Libya and	rejected the concept of parliamentary democ-
racy. Part two, published in 1977 and entitled The	Solu-
tion	of	the	Economic	Problem—Socialism,	discussed 
the weaknesses of both communism and capitalism. 
Part three, published in 1981 and entitled The	Social	
Basis	of	the	Third	Universal	Theory,	dealt with a wide 
range of issues including nationalism and the status of 
minorities and women.
Qaddafi’s  hostility  toward  Israel  and  the  West 
brought him closer to the Soviet Union. Western govern-
ments also blamed him for a series of terrorist attacks 
against civilian targets. In 1981 U.S. and Libyan air 
forces clashed over the Gulf of Sidra. Hoping to stop 
terrorist  attacks,  President  Ronald  Reagan  autho-
rized a bombing raid to assassinate Qaddafi in 1986.
