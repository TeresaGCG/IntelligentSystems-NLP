	 Democratic	Republic	of	the	Congo	(Zaïre)	 119
A United Nations peacekeeping force was called 
to restore order. However, Col. Joseph Désiré Mobutu, 
chief of staff of the army, took over the government and 
declared himself president. In 1971 he renamed the coun-
try the Republic of Zaïre. During the cold war, Mobutu 
continued to enforce his one-party system of government, 
but at the end of this period the regime suffered from 
external and internal pressures, and he acceded to imple-
ment a multiparty system with elections and a constitu-
tion. In fact, Mobutu continued ruling until 1997. 
Between 1994 and 1996 Zaïre was involved in the 
Rwanda conflict, hosting large numbers of refugees in 
its border territory. This situation caused trouble when
