larly meat, was even greater. Whereas obesity was an increasing problem among the wealthy, mal-
nutrition and hunger continued to threaten the health and longevity of the poor. 
 
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY 
The pace of scientific and technological discovery surged in the second half of the 20th century 
and showed no sign of ebbing in the 21st. Although most discoveries further enriched the world’s 
wealthiest nations, as had been true since the onset of the Industrial Revolution, other countries, 
including China, India, South Korea, Taiwan, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and South Africa, began to 
pose an energetic challenge to the West and Japan. 
For the United States and Soviet Union, the cold war was for many years the engine that drove 
innovation. Both nations’ huge spending on military projects often also yielded important scientific 
information and an array of new consumer products. Among innovations that began in the defense 
sector were jet aircraft, lasers and global positioning devices, electronic computers, and the Internet. 
“Big Science” and “Big Technology,” carried out in government agencies, major universities, and 
huge corporate laboratories, created what U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower criticized in a 1961 
speech as the “military-industrial complex.” Eisenhower was not the only American, or human, to 
fear a world led by the “scientific-technological elite.” During this period, the legitimacy of science 
and invention would be undercut by growing environmental degradation, chemical and atomic 
disasters, the emergence of dangerous new diseases, and troubling ethical questions.
The Space Frontier. Both Britain and Germany flew jet-propelled airplanes into battle during 
World War II, but commercial use of these much faster planes grew slowly in the postwar years. By 
1955, the Soviets had jets in service; an early passenger was Premier Nikita Khrushchev. The U.S. 
airline industry, profitably flying propeller planes, took longer to introduce jet engines. But by 1959, 
Pan American World Airways was flying Boeing 707 jets from New York to Paris, halving the time 
of the trip.
Meanwhile, military pilots were testing the limits of terrestrial flight. In 1947, American pilot 
Chuck Yeager, piloting a Bell X-1 jet, officially exceeded Mach 1, the speed of sound (approximately 
660 miles per hour). Although supersonic flight led to outer space programs, it failed commercially. 
Concorde, the British-French luxury passenger plane, could fly at twice the speed of sound but was 
expensive to operate and limited to certain airports. The Concorde fleet was withdrawn from ser-
vice in 2003, three years after its only fatal crash. 
The Space Race began on October 4, 1957, when the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the world’s 
first artificial satellite, into earth orbit. Sputnik was no bigger than a basketball, but its successful 
98-minute trip was seen by alarmed Americans as a huge Soviet victory. Within months, the United 
States kicked its embryonic space program into high gear. In June 1958, Congress authorized the 
creation of NASA, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. 
Although the Soviet Union and United States were the main competitors in the space program, 
France, under Premier Charles de Gaulle, and other nations were also motivated by Sputnik. The 
Soviets were first to put humans in space; only American missions set humans on the Moon, the first 
time in 1969. As the cold war waned, national prestige missions mostly gave way to scientific space 
exploration and commercial ventures. The U.S. Space Shuttle program began in 1972. The Soviet 
Union manned a space station, which later became an international endeavor. Europe’s Ariane 
program in 1980 became a private venture that marketed space opportunities, including satellite 
launches. In 2003, China successfully launched an astronaut. 
Astronomers and cosmologists sought more basic information about the universe—its age, ori-
gins, and size. American Edwin Hubble and Briton Stephen Hawking were among those seeking to 
define the beginning of the universe. The so-called big bang theory, now accepted by virtually all 
scientists, posits an explosion 10 to 15 billion years ago, with Earth’s solar system appearing about 
5 billion years ago. Hubble (1889–1953) was honored in 1990 when the Hubble	Space	Telescope 
began sending back images of the universe unimpeded by Earth’s atmosphere. Unmanned missions
