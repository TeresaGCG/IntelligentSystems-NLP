	 Brezhnev,	Leonid	Ilyich
Brezhnev spent the next two years in Kazakhstan, 
where he became involved in developing new lands for 
agriculture.  According  to  official  Soviet  government 
publications, Brezhnev greatly enjoyed his time there. It 
was during his time in Kazakhstan that Brezhnev became 
an ally of Nikita Khruschev and in 1957 succeeded  
Kliment Voroshilov as chairman of the presidium of the 
Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, and thus the chief 
of state—or president of the Soviet Union—from May 7, 
1960, until he resigned on July 15, 1964, to take a more 
active part in Communist Party affairs.
On October 14, 1964, Brezhnev took part in the 
ousting of Khrushchev as first secretary of the CPSU 
and took his place, with a strong ally in Alexei Kosygin,
