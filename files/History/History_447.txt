The most striking result of the baby boom was the activ-
ism of college students during the 1960s. In the United 
States, the initial impetus for student activism came from 
the Civil Rights movement. As the decade wore on, 
students in the United States and elsewhere found more 
elements of the “establishment” that required political 
action: the Vietnam War, the draft, and charges that 
universities were complicit with the military.
The first major student protest organization, the Stu-
dent Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), was 
founded in 1960 by Ella Baker, who had organized the 
Southern Christian Leadership Conference for Martin 
Luther King, Jr. She believed that existing civil rights 
organizations were out of touch with African-American 
students who were willing to push the movement further. 
Also in 1960 Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) 
emerged from the Student League for Industrial Democ-
racy, created in the 1930s to try to build a political left in 
Great Depression America.
SDS became the central institution of what would 
soon be called the New Left. In June 1962, 59 SDS mem-
bers and sympathizers, including some SNCC members, 
assembled at an AFL-CIO camp in Port Huron, Michi-
gan, to develop a political manifesto. The resulting Port 
Huron Statement was written by student Tom Hayden. 
It suggested that U.S. universities should become the 
locus for a new movement concerned with empowering 
individuals and communities.
SNCC was the first of these organizations to achieve 
national prominence. Its members, who had initiated  
sit-ins at segregated lunch counters, took part in the
