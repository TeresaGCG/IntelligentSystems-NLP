Son. About 250,000 Chinese troops were deployed, 
together with militia, the air force, and a naval detach-

hardened Vietnamese regrouped against the advance 
of the PLA. The Soviet Union declined to respond to

showed  that  Communist  nations  harbored  historic 
resentments against one another: Vietnam’s territo-
rial ambition in Southeast Asia, and China’s attitude 
toward small states in areas of its historic influence. 
The conflict put Vietnam firmly in the Soviet camp 
until the end of the cold war. The fighting continued 
at a low level along the border.
