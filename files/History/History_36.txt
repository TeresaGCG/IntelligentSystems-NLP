large slums, inhabited mostly by migrants from rural regions, also surrounded many African and 
Asian cities. Higher population density also made many more people vulnerable to natural disasters 
such as the 2004 tsunami that devastated parts of Southeast Asia, or the periodic earthquakes that 
have killed tens of thousands in Turkey, Iran, and Indonesia. 
During the 1950s and 1960s, the struggle for independence in Asia and Africa led to the creation 
of a host of newly independent states that often turned toward the Soviet model of a planned econ-
omy in attempts to foster rapid development. In Central and South America working-class peoples’ 
organizations began to emerge in both rural and urban areas. In contrast, in industrialized nations 
such as the United States trade union membership dropped. With end of the cold war, most formerly 
Communist nations, as well as those like India that had emulated the socialist model, dismantled 
state-owned enterprises in favor of capitalism and privatization. After the death of Mao Zedong, 
China also abandoned most state-owned enterprises in favor of free-market ones.
The gap between the rich and poor globally, and within many nations, widened in the later 
part of the 20th century. In the post–cold war era, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and 
World Bank often demanded privatization and opening up of markets as prerequisites for loans and 
assistance to African, Asian, and Latin American nations. As socialist economies in eastern Europe 
collapsed or were dismantled, many workers lost the social safety net that socialist states had once 
provided. Nations in western Europe continued to provide a wide range of social benefits including 
healthcare for their citizens, while some oil rich Middle Eastern nations such as Kuwait and Libya 
implemented sweeping welfare states to provide free education, health care, and a host of other ben-
efits for their citizens. In contrast, although one of the richest and most powerful nations on Earth, 
the United States failed to implement universal health care for its citizens.
By 2006 almost a billion people (out of a world total of over 6 billion)—mostly in Africa, Cen-
tral and South America, and parts of Asia—lived below the extreme poverty line of $1 per day. 
Although wealthy European nations, the United States, and Japan talked about and implemented 
some debt renegotiations or cancellations, huge debts continued to burden the poorest countries.
The status of women and family life also continued to undergo major changes in the second half 
of the 20th century. Beginning in the 1960s, women in Western nations again entered the workforce 
in large numbers. The development of the birth control pill and other forms of contraception in the 
1950s and beyond opened new social horizons for women, while the Kinsey Report on Sex in 1948 
resulted in a more open attitude on sexuality. Laws that made abortion legal were enacted in many 
Western nations and Japan. To prevent a continuing population explosion, China had enacted a 
strict one-child-per-couple rule by 1980. Abortion also became a major issue of social and political 
conflict in the United States and some other nations. Likewise, homosexual and lesbian demands 
for equal rights exacerbated political differences between liberals and conservatives, especially in 
the United States. 
New generations of feminists also demanded the extension of equal rights and fuller politi-
cal and economic participation for women around the world. For example, Doria Shafik in Egypt 
campaigned for voting rights for women and better educational opportunities, while Simone de 
Beauvoir of France, Betty Friedan in the United States, and Germaine Greer from Australia called 
for equality in jobs, equal pay for equal work, and changes in social mores on housework and child 
care and other traditional female roles. Old stereotypes of “women’s” versus “men’s” work were 
challenged. Women also played important roles in revolutions in the developing nations, as in Viet-
nam and Algeria. While many women have risen to lead their governments, many others failed to 
gain equal rights in their post-independence countries. Women’s international congresses in Mexico, 
China, and elsewhere have continued to address the problems of persistent inequality of payment 
for work, human rights, and access to education. Women’s rights have also been set back in the 
United States by the failure to gain ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment and in many Muslim 
countries because of fundamentalist interpretations of Islam.
