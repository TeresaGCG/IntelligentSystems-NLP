a Soviet “Iron Curtain” that was turning eastern European nations, including the Soviet sector in 
eastern Germany, into satellite states while projecting communist influence around the world. The 
cold war was under way.
Although the United States and Soviet Union never directly attacked one another—hence the 
term “cold” war—the superpowers engaged in a costly arms race and spent blood and treasure in a 
series of “proxy” wars in Korea, Vietnam, and Afghanistan. Wars of decolonization that included 
French Algeria, Dutch Indonesia, and French, British, Belgian, and Portuguese sub-Saharan Afri-
ca erupted in many regions still trying to throw off Western imperialism. The United States and 
the Soviet Union regularly used independence movements as opportunities to outdo one another 
by providing intelligence, arms, and covert assistance to their presumed allies. Both “proxy” and 
“decolonizing” wars played out in a bipolar world in which the Americans and Soviets each pressed 
the rest of the world’s nations to take their side. Many did so; others, including India, precariously 
maintained nonaligned status.
Both the United States and the Soviet Union were permanent members of the United Nations 
Security Council, but they also took steps to secure their own allies. NATO—the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization—founded in 1949, became a mutual security body prepared to respond mili-
tarily to possible Soviet incursions. Moscow responded in 1955 to NATO’s admission of West Ger-
many by creating the Warsaw Pact, a mutual defense agreement between the Soviet Union and most 
eastern European nations in the Soviet orbit. 
The Soviet Union intervened militarily to crush revolts in Hungary (1956), Czechoslovakia 
(1968), and Poland (1981) and built the Berlin Wall to prevent East Germans from escaping to 
the West. The United States also intensified efforts to control client nations in Central America, 
sometimes intervening militarily to prevent the emergence there of reform movements that were, or 
seemed to be, inspired by communism. Cuban revolutionary leader Fidel Castro’s embrace of the 
Soviet Union after 1959 was a rare failure of U.S. influence in the Western Hemisphere. 
Arms Race. The most significant but least-used weapon of the cold war era was the nuclear 
bomb and its associated adaptations. After the Soviets fabricated their own A-bomb in 1949, other 
nations were soon preparing to join the nuclear “club.” Since then, Britain, France, China, India, 
Pakistan, Israel, South Africa, and North Korea have built bombs or are believed to have developed 
bomb technology, despite international efforts to check nuclear weapons proliferation. In 1951, the 
United States tested an even more powerful hydrogen, or H-, bomb and began expanding its fleet of 
nuclear-powered submarines. As the arms race intensified, both sides turned to rocket technology to 
create intercontinental ballistic missile systems; virtually all of these were designed to drop nuclear 
warheads on enemy targets or fire them from submarines. 
Many historians now agree that this bilateral binge of nuclear weapons stockpiling was a major 
reason why the United States and the Soviet Union managed to avoid going to war with each other. 
The cold war weapons buildup that produced what came to be called MAD—mutually assured 
destruction—certainly caused anxiety. Americans were urged to build backyard fallout shelters to 
protect their families from radiation.
During the Cuban missile crisis in 1962, U.S. President John F. Kennedy and Premier Nikita 
Khrushchev squared off over Soviet installation of nuclear weapons in Cuba. War was narrowly 
averted, but the likelihood that both nations could suffer deaths and damage of unprecedented 
magnitude helped to defuse the impasse. In 1963 Kennedy and Khrushchev signed a treaty banning 
above-ground nuclear testing; by the 1970s, the two nations were negotiating agreements to slow 
or even reduce nuclear weapons development
After 1950, the U.S. Air Force emerged the big winner in the internal Pentagon race for respect 
and resources. The biggest, most expensive improvements in both offensive and defensive weaponry 
focused on manned and unmanned aircraft and missiles. Aircraft carriers and submarines domi-
nated the seas, while versatile armored helicopters took on important combat roles. After the Soviet 
Union successfully launched Sputnik in 1957, the first satellite in orbit, the idea of “air” power took 
on an outer space dimension. Although the perceived Sputnik military threat fizzled, in 1983 Ronald
