Barzani’s call for Kurdish independence, and in 1961 he 
renewed fighting with the Kurds. From 1961 to 1963 
and from 1974 to 1975, Mustafa Barzani led an armed 
struggle. Later in the 1970s Barzani went into exile in 
the United States, where he died in 1979.
In 1979 Masoud Barzani succeeded his father to 
lead the KDP. With the help of thousands of armed 
fighters, the peshmargan, he gained control of major 
parts of northern Iraq. After the First Gulf War the 
KDP emerged as one of the most significant Kurdish 
political organizations, operating with relative freedom 
to govern sections of northern Iraq while achieving the 
first enduring semiautonomous Kurdish state in history. 
In the early 21st century Barzani continued to play a 
major role in Kurdish politics in Iraq, where he shared 
power with his Kurdish rival Jalal Talabani.
Talabani was a major Kurdish nationalist and the 
leader of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), which 
was established in 1975. Formed mainly by urban intel-
lectuals and leftist thinkers, the PUK emerged as KDP’s 
main political competitor. In the early 1990s he helped 
the Kurdish uprising against the Ba’athist state while 
working  closely  with  the  United  States,  the  United 
Kingdom, and France to establish the no-fly zone over 
northern Iraq to protect the Kurds from bombing and 
chemical attacks by Saddam Hussein’s army. After 
years of rivalry, the PUK joined forces with the KDP 
and other Kurdish parties to create the Democratic 
Patriotic Alliance of Kurdistan to represent the Kurds
