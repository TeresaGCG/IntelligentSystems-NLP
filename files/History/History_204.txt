Gaulle won reelection to the presidency over François 
Mitterrand in 1965. Yet trouble was on the horizon. 
Although his tenure was generally a time of economic 
prosperity  and  modernization,  many  citizens  chafed 
at the lack of social and cultural modernization. The 
events of May 1968, when students and labor union 
members engaged in protests and strikes, posed a prob-
lem for de Gaulle. Much to the public’s consternation 
he disappeared from France by helicopter on May 29. 
After returning from an evening in Baden Baden, where 
he consulted with a French general, he gave a radio 
address in which he stressed the need to remain intran-
sigent about the necessity of public order.
The legislative campaigns that followed de Gaulle’s 
dissolution of the assembly did little to eliminate the 
social fissures that had been revealed and exacerbated by 
the events of May 1968. The president became more cut 
off from the citizenry, while the new assembly refused 
necessary reforms. Ignoring his advisers, de Gaulle put 
planned reforms of the Senate to referendum in 1969. 
French  voters  responded  negatively.  He  immediately 
announced his resignation and returned to his estate.
In the year prior to his death he wrote his Mémoirs	
d’espoir (only the first volume of which was completed) 
and received visitors at his estate. De Gaulle was buried 
in the local church according to his instructions.
