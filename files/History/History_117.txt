	 Bush,	George	W.	 5
The oldest son of President George H. W. Bush, 
Bush was raised in Texas where his father had moved 
to start his Zapata Oil corporation, and like other men 
in his family, attended Yale University where he earned 
a degree in history and was a member of the Skull and 
Bones society. While his father and grandfather had served 
in the navy during wartime, he served in the Air Nation-
al Guard during the Vietnam War. Bush has described 
this period of his life as irresponsible and informed by 
bad choices, characterized by excessive drinking. After 
a failed congressional bid, he spent most of the 1980s 
working in the oil industry before purchasing a share of 
the Texas Rangers baseball team, of which he served as 
general manager from 1989 to 1994.
