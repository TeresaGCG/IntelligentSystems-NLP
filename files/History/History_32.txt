overseas. Most poor countries remained dependent on the export of low-priced single crops, such 
as coffee from Brazil, bananas and other fruits from Central America, and cocoa and peanuts 
from West Africa.
By the 21st century, privatization and globalization had further lowered the prices of agricul-
tural products from nations in the Global South, leading to greater rural poverty. The United States 
and others also sought to export wheat; hence, in Mexico and other South American nations wheat 
bread gradually began to undermine the popularity of the traditional corn tortillas that provided 
more complete nutrients. Similarly, mothers in much of the Global South were encouraged to buy 
manufactured milk formulas rather than nursing their infants. The degradation of the environment 
also made it harder for the rural poor to eke out livelihoods on depleted and deforested soils with 
insufficient water supplies. In contrast, heavy government subsidies and protectionist policies pro-
tected farmers and the agricultural sector in Europe, North America, and Australasia. 
Technological and political developments led to the increase of food production and distribu-
tion in many regions. Improved transportation and communication systems allowed food from rich 
agricultural nations, especially the United States, Canada, and Australia, to be distributed in poor 
regions. International humanitarian aid organizations and aid benefits by rock stars and others 
helped to provide needed relief. Scientific and technological advances and chemical fertilizers also 
increased the yields of vital grains per acre. 
However, the application of these developments was uneven. Poor countries used the least 
amount of fertilizers; ranging from 200 grams per hectare of arable land in the Central African 
Republic to 535,800 grams per hectare in South Korea. Pesticide use was similarly uneven. The 
“green revolution” begun in the 1960s introduced high-yielding rice, corn, and wheat; as a result 
of the use of these high-yield crops, the world’s rice production doubled between 1967 and 1992, 
and India went from being a grain-importing nation to an exporter of rice. Harvests in Mexico 
and other nations also increased. Thus, formerly famine-prone nations such as India, Bangladesh, 
China, and Mexico were able to produce sufficient food to feed their growing populations, although 
pockets of hunger and malnutrition remained. By the 1990s scientists had also successfully geneti-
cally modified (GM) key crops and livestock to increase production. 
Vast irrigation projects such as the Aswa¯n Dam in Egypt, the Three Gorges Dam in China, and 
the Atatürk Dam in Turkey also brought new land into agricultural production, as well as generating 
electrical power for civilian use and industry. Unfortunately, these projects came at high ecological 
and human costs. Some argued that smaller, more technologically appropriate projects might have 
produced the same results at lower human and economic costs. 
The development of new and less perishable foodstuffs was sometimes driven by wars or the 
military. For example, during World War II, instant eggs and Spam were adopted as rations to feed 
troops. After the war, many in the West adopted these products as part of their usual diets. The 
space program also contributed to the development of high-energy drinks and dehydrated foods. 
A wide variety of easily available and inexpensive frozen foods provided convenience to Western 
 homemakers who eagerly fed TV dinners and other “fast foods” to their families. These new food-
stuffs altered the eating habits of many in the West and freed homemakers, mostly women, from 
long hours spent in food preparation. Fast-food franchises proliferated from the West to Russia, 
the Middle East, India, and China. The wealthy around the world adopted Western eating styles 
and foodstuffs, including soft drinks, hamburgers, and pizza. Conversely, Asian cuisine from India, 
Thailand, and China became popular in the United States and Europe. Other new foodstuffs, includ-
ing a wide variety of soft drinks, were popular worldwide. 
Health concerns, especially among the middle and upper classes in the West, contributed to the 
popularity of organic foods and eating locally grown products that were close to nature. Many also 
adopted the Mediterranean diet heavy with fruits and vegetables with little meat. The poor in the West 
and the rest of the world were generally unable to afford these more expensive foodstuffs or diets.
Hence although much of the world’s population was better fed by the beginning of the 21st 
century, people in Europe, North America, Japan, and Australasia consumed about one-third more
