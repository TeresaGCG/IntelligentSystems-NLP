Hu	Yaobang	(Hu	Yao-pang)
(1915–1989) Chinese	politician
Hu Yaobang was born to a peasant family in Hunan 
Province and joined the Chinese Communist forces 
at age 14. He became a party member in 1933. He 
became a protégé of Deng Xiaoping after serving 
under him in the Chinese Red Army, although they 
had many differences of opinion on political and phil-
osophical issues. After the formation of the People’s 
Republic of China in 1949, Hu held many positions 
within the national government.
Hu became head of the Communist Party’s Propagan-
da Department, then became general secretary in 1980 
and chair in 1981. Hu attempted to create a more flex-
ible, less dogmatic government that would seek practical 
and flexible solutions to particular problems rather than
