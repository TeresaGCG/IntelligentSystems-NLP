ellite systems, videocassettes, and cell phone networks all provided easy and relatively inexpensive 
access to wide a range of musical, artistic, and dramatic productions throughout the world. Inter-
national hotel and fast food chains also helped to popularize Western tastes. Tourism, boosted by 
cheap jet airplane travel, enabled millions to see and enjoy other cultures. 
The 1960s was a decade of major cultural changes, especially among Western youth and the 
elites worldwide. The Woodstock rock festival in 1969 was a centerpiece of the hippie generation, 
which advocated “turning on, tuning in, and dropping out” and rock and roll music and dance. 
Cultural fusions were particularly apparent in music. Western rock-and-roll musicians helped to 
popularize Africa, Caribbean, and other traditional music and sometimes brought indigenous artists 
from Africa and South America to the attention of international audiences for the first time. Jazz, 
hip hop, Latin influences, and rai (a fusion of traditional Arabic and urban Western motifs) from 
North Africa attracted music lovers from around the world. Similar fusions of indigenous materials 
and motifs, along with eco-friendly styles, in art and architecture also became popular.
While English became the universal second language, attempts were made to preserve and revi-
talize indigenous languages. The Nigerian author, Wole Soyinka, spoke widely on the awareness 
among Africans of their own rich cultural heritage. For example, the Kenyan novelist Ngugi wa 
Thiong’o wrote in his native language Gikuyu, which had been banned in his school while the 
British ruled Kenya. Similarly, Amadou Hampate Ba of Mali spoke impassionately at UNESCO to 
preserve African oral traditions, or, as he expressed it, “In Africa, when an old man dies, it is like a 
whole library burning down.” 
The tensions between secularism and religion apparent at the beginning of the 20th century inten-
sified at its end. While western European societies became increasingly secular, by the 1970s militant 
Islamists across the Muslim world wanted to return to early Islamic practices and governments that 
operated under Islamic law and challenged Western cultural hegemony. Some Christian fundamen-
talists in the West, especially in the United States, Hindus in India, and Jews in Israel also wanted to 
created religiously based governments and judicial systems in their nations. Although the conflict of 
secular Westernization with tradition and religion promised to continue in the Islamic world, other 
leaders in these nations expressed their desires for the preservation of the best of their own traditional 
cultures with the adaptation of what they considered the best of Western civilization.
Hence, ongoing and seemingly endless technological advances made the world smaller, enabling 
peoples to travel, trade, and communicate almost instantaneously. It also provided the means 
through which the rich industrialized nations could dominate and largely control world trade and 
communications and popularize Western culture worldwide. At the same time, peoples around the 
world attempted, with varying degrees of success, to preserve their ancient traditions, languages, 
and religions. Some sought to maintain their individual societies through divisive and sometimes 
violent racism, sectarianism, and ethnocentrism. However, as the 21st century progressed, many 
others struggled to maintain their individuality, taking the best of other cultures while sharing the 
best of their own.
WARFARE 
Warfare in the second half of the 20th century was dominated by the cold war, which for 45 years 
pitted nuclear superpowers, the United States and Soviet Union, against one another. At the same 
time, this era also experienced extensive ethnic, religious, and territorial conflict. This often meant 
that military forces equipped with technologically advanced weapons of mass destruction found 
themselves in battle with guerrilla fighters armed with makeshift or outdated weapons. The well-
equipped warriors did not always win.
The waning days of World War II set new hostilities in motion as the Soviets competed with 
their Allies to be the first to liberate Axis-held territories in both Europe and Asia. At a 1945 con-
ference at Yalta, three months before Germany surrendered, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, U.S. presi-
dent Franklin D. Roosevelt, and British prime minister Winston Churchill agreed to a buffer zone 
between the USSR and Germany. By 1946, Churchill, speaking at a Missouri college, was decrying
