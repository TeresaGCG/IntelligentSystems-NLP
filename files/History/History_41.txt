Reagan, America’s last cold war president, proposed a strategic defense initiative, dubbed “Star 
Wars,” to shoot down Soviet missiles from positions in space.
Proxy Wars. Three major conflicts between 1950 and 1989 demonstrated attempts by the two 
superpowers (and Communist China) to “win” the cold war militarily and ideologically. These were 
the Korean War (1950–53) and Vietnam War (1954–75), in which U.S. troops played a leading role, 
and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan (1979–89). None of these conflicts proved very productive 
for the superpowers. 
With the blessing of the United Nations (during a Soviet boycott of the Security Council), the 
United States assembled a multinational force to repel efforts by Communist North Korea to con-
quer pro-Western South Korea. Soon, the new Chinese Communist regime came to the aid of North 
Korea, complicating any chance for a United Nations–led victory. This war ended with an armistice 
that never became a peace treaty. Hostilities continued to break out along the DMZ (demilitarized 
zone) separating North and South Korea.
Soviet intervention in a civil war–wracked Afghanistan ended 10 years later in a failure so profound 
that it became a factor in the breakup of the Soviet Union soon after. The U.S. government, inter-
preting the Afghan conflict through a cold war lens, provided the latest weapons, including Stinger 
missiles, to local warlords. A decade later, these weapons would reappear as disaffected ethnic and 
religious groups in Asia and the Middle East mounted anti-American and anti-Russian attacks.
Vietnam was the longest of these “proxy” contests and, for a time, made Americans question 
national power and the U.S. role in a world of nations. As Japan withdrew from its Asian conquests 
at the end of World War II, the French tried to resume colonial control in Indochina. Vietnamese 
leader Ho Chi Minh, a Communist, sought independence. By the time France withdrew in 1954 
after a major defeat at Dien Bien Phu, the United States had assumed the role of protecting the 
southern sector of politically divided Vietnam from its “red” brethren in North Vietnam.
For 10 years U.S. involvement in South Vietnam drew little public attention and was carried 
out by relatively small numbers of military advisers and intelligence agents. These Americans were 
supposed to strengthen South Vietnam’s military and political structures to prevent what President 
Dwight D. Eisenhower called the “domino effect.” This was the idea that communism had to be 
contained—ideologically if possible, militarily if necessary—wherever it appeared. The U.S.-backed 
South Vietnamese government headed by Ngo Dinh Diem was corrupt and unpopular. In 1963 a 
U.S.-instigated military coup assassinated Diem. In 1964, an apparent clash between North Viet-
namese vessels and a U.S. warship spying in North Vietnam’s Gulf of Tonkin gave President Lyndon 
B. Johnson a free hand in Vietnam, despite his having no congressional declaration of war.
Militarily, Vietnam was a conflict between a massively armed superpower and guerrilla fight-
ers known as the Vietcong. Aided by regular North Vietnamese troops and outfitted with Chinese 
and Warsaw Pact–supplied weapons, these fighters used their knowledge of Vietnam’s terrain, 
jungle climate, and people to fight on, despite U.S. attacks with napalm, a deadly defoliant, and 
air raids that dropped 8 million tons of bombs on Vietnam, more than any other country had ever 
experienced.
One collateral casualty of Vietnam for the United States was the end of its system of universal 
military service. After World War II, the United States continued mandatory military training for 
young men. As a result, the U.S. Army expanded to 3.5 million soldiers. As manpower needs in the 
undeclared war in Vietnam required more American troops—peaking at 541,000 in 1969—resis-
tance to the war also increased. College students used generous deferment policies to postpone 
conscription; when that failed, a friendly doctor might issue a diagnosis of disease or mental illness. 
Draft protesters publicly burned their Selective Service documents, and thousands fled, mostly to 
Canada and Sweden, to avoid the draft. 
Warfare in a Postcolonial and Post–Cold War World. As the Soviet Union unraveled between 
1989, when the Berlin Wall came down, and 1991, when its last premier, Mikhail Gorbachev, 
resigned, some thought, briefly, that a time of peace might be at hand. In fact, the demise of a world 
order shaped by two superpowers helped intensify existing ethnic, religious, and political rivalries
