environmental campaigns saw protests against the kill-

undertaken by the Japanese and the Norwegians. The 
International Whaling Commission introduced a mora-
torium on whaling in 1986, although Japan has contin-
ued to conduct whaling under the guise of science. Inter-
national environmental organizations such as Friends 
of the Earth and Greenpeace have been prominent in 
leading protests around the world, the latter becoming 
famous for taking part in direct action.
Developing  environmental  problems  around  the 
world have been added to by many natural occurrences 
such as hurricanes in the Caribbean, in the United States 
and elsewhere, floods in Florence and Venice in 1966, 
the eruption of volcanoes such as Mount St. Helens in 
1980, and the Indian Ocean tsunami of December 26, 
2004. In some cases there were a combination of other 
man-made environmental disasters that have involved 
feeding sheep and cattle with substandard “food.” The 
destruction of forests either for timber or to clear land 
for cash crops continues, as does the contamination of 
rivers and the countryside by waste from mines. Even 
natural disasters such as Hurricane Katrina leading 
to flooding in New Orleans in August 2005 has sub-
