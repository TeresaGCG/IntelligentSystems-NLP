By 1995 this force would be 700 soldiers strong, with 
125 specifically stationed, ready for combat, on the U.S.-
Mexican border; they killed the first suspected drug traf-
ficker, Esequiel Hernandez, there in 1997. In 1991 the 
Posse Comitatus Act amendments allowed the military 
to train civilian police in counter-drug practices.
A decade later the U.S. Coast Guard was given 
machine guns and sniper rifles to assist in efforts to inter-
dict drug traffickers. Shortly thereafter, efforts shifted 
beyond policing the U.S. borders for traffickers to send-
ing assistance to policing efforts far from the borders. 
In July 2000 Congress earmarked $1.3 billion for Plan 
Colombia military aid—adding 60 combat helicopters, 
bringing the number of U.S. troops in Colombia to 500, 
and training the Colombian military to eradicate coca 
and fight the FARC (the Revolutionary Armed Forces 
of Colombia), the country’s largest rebel group.
Efforts in the international war on drugs were not 
limited to Colombia. U.S. forces worked with the Peru-
vian air force as part of the Air Bridge Denial (ABD) 
program.  The  program  was  implemented  to  shoot 
down aircraft, such as that belonging to the infamous 
Pablo Escobar (leader of the Medellín cartel). ABD was 
stopped shortly after the April 2001 shooting down of 
a civilian aircraft carrying a U.S. missionary and a child. 
It resumed again in Colombia in August 2003 and 
had forced down 24 drug-trafficking aircraft by 2004, 
according to U.S. congressman Mark Souder (R-IN).
