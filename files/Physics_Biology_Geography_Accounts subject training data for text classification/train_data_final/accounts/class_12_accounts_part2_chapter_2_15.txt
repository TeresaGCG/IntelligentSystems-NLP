To Kapil Enterprises 18,00,000
To Sundry Creditors A/c 2,00,000

Rs 100 each)

 

In case of the whole business being taken over if the amount of debentures
issued is more than the amount of the net assets taken over, the difference (excess)
will be treated as value of goodwill and the same shall also be debited while
passing the journal entry for the purchase of vender's business (see Illustration
1 1). But if it is the other way round, i.e., the value of debentures is less than the
value of the net assets taken over the difference will be credited to capital Reserve
accounts (See Illustration 12).
