percentage is usually as part of the name of debentures like 8% debentures, 10%
debentures, etc., and interest payable is calculated at the nominal value of
debentures.

Interest on debenture is a charge against the proﬁt of the company and
must be paid whether the company has earned any profit or not. According to
Income Tax Act, 196 1, a company must deduct income tax at a prescribed rate
from the interest payable on debentures if it exceeds the prescribed limit. It is
called Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) and is to be deposited with the tax
authorities. Of course, the debentureholders can adjust this amount against
the tax due from them.
