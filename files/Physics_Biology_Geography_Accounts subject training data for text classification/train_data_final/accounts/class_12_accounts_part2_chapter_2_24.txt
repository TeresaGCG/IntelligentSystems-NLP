Notes: 1. When debentures are redeemable at a premium, a provision has to be made

right at the time of the issue by debiting the amount to ‘Loss on Issue of
Debentures A/c’. It may be noted that when debentures are issued at a
discount and are redeemable at a premium, the amount of discount on issue
is also debited to ‘Loss on Issue of Debentures'. It may be noted that when
the debentures are issued at a discount and are redeemable at par, the amount
debited to ‘Discount on Issue of Debentures A/c' as usual.

2. Premium on redemption is a liability of a company payable in future. It is a
provision and is shown under the head Non—current liabilities under sub-
head ‘Long—term Borrowings’ until debentures are redeemed.

3. Loss on issue of debentures is a capital loss and it is to be written-oil gradually
charged to statement of proﬁt and loss or securities premium account.
