2.14 Redemption by Conversion

As stated earlier the debentures can also be redeemed by converting them into
shares or new debentures. If debentureholders ﬁnd that the offer is beneﬁcial to
them, they will take advantage of this offer. The new shares or debentures may
be issued at par, at a discount or at a premium. It may be noted that no
Debenture Redemption Reserve is required in case of convertible debentures
because no funds are required for redemption.
