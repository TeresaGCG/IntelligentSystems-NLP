(i) was not posted at all
[ii] was not posted to machinery account
(iii) was not posted to depreciation account

Solution

(i) It was recorded through journal proper. From journal proper posting to all the
accounts are made individually. Hence, no posting was made to depreciation account
and machinery account. Therefore, rectification entry will be :

Depreciation A/c Dr. 2,000
To Machinery A/c 2,000
[Depreciation on machinery not posted, now corrected)

(ii) In this case posting was not made to machinery account. It is to be assumed that
depreciation account should have been correctly debited. Therefore, rectification
entry shall be :

Suspense A/c Dr. 2,000

To Machinery A/c 2,000
[Depreciation on machinery not posted to Machinery account, now
corrected).

(iii) In this case depreciation account was not been debited. However, machinery account
must have been correctly credited. Therefore, rectification entry shall be :

Depreciation A/c Dr. 2,000
To Suspense A/c 2,000
[Depreciation on machinery not posted to Depreciation account, now
corrected).
