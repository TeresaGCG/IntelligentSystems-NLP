5. 7.2 Debt to Capital Employed Ratio

The Debt to capital employed ratio refers to the ratio of long-term debt to the
total of external and internal funds (capital employed or net assets). It is computed
as follows:

Debt to Capital Employed Ratio = Long-term Debt/ Capital Employed [or Net Assets)

Capital employed is equal to the long—term debt + shareholders' funds.
Alternatively, it may be taken as net assets which are equal to the total assets —
current liabilities taking the data of Illustration 7, capital employed shall work
out to Rs. 5,00,000 + Rs. 15,00,000 = Rs. 20,00,000. Similarly, Net Assets as
Rs. 25,00,000 — Rs. 5,00,000 = Rs. 20,00,000 and the Debt to capital employed
ratio as Rs. 5,00,000/Rs. 20,00,000 = 0.25: 1.

Signiﬁcance: Like debt-equity ratio, it shows proportion of long—term debts in
capital employed. Low ratio provides security to lenders and high ratio helps
management in trading on equity. In the above case, the debt to Capital Employed
ratio is less than half which indicates reasonable funding by debt and adequate
security of debt.

It may be noted that Debt to Capital Employed Ratio can also be computed
in relation to total assets. In that case, it usually refers to the ratio of total debts
