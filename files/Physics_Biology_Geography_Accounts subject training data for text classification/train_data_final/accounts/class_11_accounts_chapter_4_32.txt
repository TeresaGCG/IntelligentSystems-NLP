4.5 Sales Return (Journal) Book

This journal is used to record return of goods by customers to them on credit.
On receipt of goods from the customer, a credit note is prepared, like the debit
note referred to earlier. The difference between the credit not and the debit
note is that the former is prepared by the seller and the latter is prepared by
the buyer. Like the debit note, the credit note is also prepared in duplicate
and contains detail relating to the name of the customer, details of the
merchandise received back and the amount. Each credit note is serially
numbered and dated. The source document for recording entries in the sales
return book is generally the credit note. The format of the sales return book is
shown in figure 4.9
