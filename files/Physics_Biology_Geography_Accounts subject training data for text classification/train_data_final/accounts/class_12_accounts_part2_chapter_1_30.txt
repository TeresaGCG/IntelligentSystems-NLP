1.6.6 Issue of Shares at a Discount

There are instances when the shares of a company are issued at a discount, i.e.
at an amount less than the nominal or par value of shares, the difference between
the nominal value and issue price representing discount on the issue of shares.
For example, when a share of the nominal value of Rs. 100 is issued at Rs. 98, it
is said to have been issued at a discount of two per cent.

As a general rule, a company cannot ordinarily issue shares at a discount. It
can do so only in cases such as â€˜reissue of forfeited shares' (to be discussed later)
and issue of sweat equity shares.
