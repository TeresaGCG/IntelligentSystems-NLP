Debit and Credit Notes

A Debit note is a document evidencing a debit to be raised against a party for reasons
other than sale on credit. On finding that goods supplied are not as per the terms of
the order placed, the defective goods are returned to the supplier of the goods and a
note is prepared to debit the supplier; or when an additional sum is recoverable
from a customer such a note is prepared to debit the customer with the additional
dues. In these two situations the note is called a debit note (refer figure 4.7(b)].

A Credit note is prepared, when a party is to be given a credit for reasons other
than credit purchase. It is a common practice to make it in red ink. When goods are
received back from a customer, a credit note should be sent to him. The suggested
proforma of credit note is shown in figure 4.7(c).
