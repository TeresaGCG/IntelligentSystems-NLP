4.3 Purchases Return (Journal) Book

In this book, purchases return of goods are recorded. Sometimes goods
purchased are returned to the supplier for various reasons such as the goods
are not of the required quality, or are defective, etc. For every return, a debit
note (in duplicate) is prepared and the original one is sent to the supplier for
making necessary entries in his book. The supplier may also prepare a note,
Which is called the credit note. The source document for recording entries in
the purchases return journal is generally a debit note. A debit note Will contain
the name of the party (to Whom the goods have been returned) details of the
goods returned and the reason for returning the goods. Each debit note is
serially numbered and dated. The format of the purchases return journal is
shown in figure 4.7(a).
