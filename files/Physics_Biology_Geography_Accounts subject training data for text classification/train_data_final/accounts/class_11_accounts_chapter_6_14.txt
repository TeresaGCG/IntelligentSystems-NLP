Accountancy

Credit sales to Mohan ? 10,000 was correctly recorded in the sales book but was
posted to Ram’s account. This is an error of commission. The effect of wrong posting
has been:

Ram’s A/c Dr. 10,000

To Sales A/c 10.000

Correct effect should have been :

Mohan’s A/c Dr. 1 0,000

To Sales A/c 10,000

Notice that there is no error in sales account. But Ram’s account has been
debited with ? 10,000 instead of Mohan’s account.

Hence rectification entry will be:

Mohan’s A/c Dr. 10,000

To Ram’s A/c 10,000

Rent paid ? 2,000 was wrongly shown as payment to landlord in the cash
book:
The effect of wrong posting has been:

Landlord’s A/c Dr. 2,000

To Cash A/c 2,000

Correct effect should have been:

Rent A/c Dr. 2,000

To Cash A/c 2,000

Landlord’s account has been wrongly debited instead of Rent account.
Hence, rectification entry will be:

Rent A/c Dr. 2,000

To Landlord’s A/c 2,000
