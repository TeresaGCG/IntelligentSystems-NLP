Issue and Redemption of Debentures 73

Bond: Bond is also an instrument of acknowledgement of debt. Traditionally,
the Government issued bonds, but these days, bonds are also being issued by
semi—government and non—governmental organisations. The terms ‘debentures'
and ‘Bonds' are now being used inter-changeably.

2.2 Distinction between Shares and Debentures

Ownership: A ‘share' represents ownership of the company whereas a debenture
is only acknowledgement of Debt. A share is a part of the owned capital whereas
a debenture is a part of borrowed capital.

Return: The return on shares is known as dividend while the return on
debentures is called interest. The rate of return on shares may vary from year to
year depending upon the proﬁts of the company but the rate of interest on
debentures is prefixed. The payment of dividend is an appropriation of proﬁts,
whereas the payment of interest is a charge on proﬁts and is to be paid even if
there is no proﬁt.

Repayment: Normally, the amount of shares is not returned during the life of
the company, whereas, generally, the debentures are issued for a speciﬁed period
and repayable on the expiry of that period. However, in the year 1998, the
amendements (Section 77A and 77 B sub Section 2) in the Companies Act,
permitted companies to buy back its shares specially when market value of
shares are less than its book value.

Voting Rights: Shareholders enjoy voting rights whereas debentureholders do
not normally enjoy any voting right.

Security : Shares are not secured by any charge whereas the debentures are
generally secured and carry a ﬁxed or ﬂoating charge over the assets of the
company.

Convertibility: Shares cannot be converted into debentures whereas debentures

can be converted into shares if the terms of issue so provide, and in that case
these are known as convertible debentures.
