Posting from the Petty Cash Book

The petty cash book is balanced periodically. The difference between the total
receipts and total payments is the balance with the petty cashier. The balance is
carried to the next period and the petty cashier is paid the amount actually spent.
A petty cash account is opened in the ledger. It is debited with the amount given
to petty cashier. Each expense account is individually debited with the periodic
total as per the respective column by writing “petty cash account” and the petty
cash account is credited with the total expenditure incurred during the period by
writing sundries as per petty cash book. The petty cash account is balanced. It
reﬂect the actual cash with the petty cashier.
