(ii) Loans repayable on demand or whose original tenure is not more than
twelve months / operating cycle are classified as short-term borrowings
on the face of balance sheet.

(iii) Current maturities to long-term loan include amount repayable within
twelve months / operating cycle under other current liabilities with Note
to Account.

Deferred tax assets/ liabilities are always non—current. This is in accordance
to IAS-I.

Trade payables

Sundry creditors have been replaced with the term Trade payables and are
classiﬁed as current and non—current. Trade payables to be settled beyond 12
months from the date of balance sheet or beyond the operating cycle are classiﬁed
under “other long-term liabilities” with Note to Account. For example, purchase
of goods and services in normal course of business. The balance of trade payables
are classiﬁed as current liabilities on the face of balance sheet.

Provisions

The amount of provision settled within 12 months from balance sheet date or
within operating cycle period from date of its recognition is classiﬁed as short
term provisions and shown under current liabilities on the face of balance sheet.
Others are depicted as long-term provisions under non-current liabilities on the
face of balance sheet.

Fixed assets

There is no change in the treatment of ﬁxed assets. Both tangible and intangible
assets are non—current. This may also be noted if the useful life of the asset is
less than 12 months, it will still fall under non—current.

Investments

Investments are also classified into current and non-current categories.
Investments expected to realise within twelve months are considered as current
investments under current assets. Others are classified as non—current
investments under non-current assets. Both are however shown on the face of
the balance sheet.

Inventories
All inventories are always treated as current.
