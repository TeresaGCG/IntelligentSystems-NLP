0 Interest paid on debentures and long-term loans and advances.

It is important to mention here that a transaction may include cash ﬂows
that are classiﬁed differently. For example, when the instalment paid in respect
of a ﬁxed asset acquired on deferred payment basis includes both interest and
loan, the interest element is classiﬁed under ﬁnancing activities and the loan
element is classiﬁed under investing activities. Moreover, same activity may be
classiﬁed differently for different enterprises. For example, purchase of shares is
an operating activity for a share brokerage ﬁrm while it is investing activity in
case of other enterprises.
