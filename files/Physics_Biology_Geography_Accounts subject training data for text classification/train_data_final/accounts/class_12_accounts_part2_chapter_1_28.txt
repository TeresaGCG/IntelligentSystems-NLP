1 . 6.4 Under Subscription

Under subscription is a situation where number of shares applied for is less
than the number for which applications have been invited for subscription. For
example, a comapny offered 2 lakh shares for subscription to the public but the
applications were received for 1,90,000 shares, only. In such a situation, the
allotment will be confirmed to 1 ,90,000 shares and entries shall be made
accordingly. However, as stated earlier, it must be ensured that the company
has received the minimum subscriptions and the company will have to refund
the entire subscription amount received.

1.6.5 Issue of Shares at a Premium

It is quite common for the shares of financially strong and well—managed
companies to be issued at a premium, i.e. at an amount more than the nominal
or par value of shares. Thus, when a share of the nominal value of Rs. 100 is
issued at Rs. 105, it is said to have been issued at a premium of 5 per cent.
When the issue of shares is at a premium, the amount of premium may
technically be called at any stage of the issue of shares. However, premium is
generally called with the amount due on allotment, sometimes with the
application money and rarely with the call money. The premium amount is
credited to a separate account called ‘Securities Premium Account’ and is
shown under the title ‘Equity and Liabilities’ of the company’s balance sheet
under the head ‘Reserves and Surpluses’. It can be used only for the following
ﬁve purposes:
(a) to issue fully paid bonus shares to the extent not exceeding unissued
share capital of the company;
(b) to write-off preliminary expenses of the company;
(0) to write-off the expenses of, or commission paid, or discount allowed
on any securities of the company; and
(d) to pay premium on the redemption of preference shares or debentures
of the company.
