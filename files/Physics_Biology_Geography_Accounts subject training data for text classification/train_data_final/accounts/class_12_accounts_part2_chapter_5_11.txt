repayment of principal amount at the end of the loan period. Solvency ratios
are calculated to determine the ability of the business to service its debt in
the long run. The following ratios are normally computed for evaluating
solvency of the business.

1. Debt-Equity Ratio;

2 Debt to Capital Employed Ratio;
3. Proprietary Ratio;

4 Total Assets to Debt Ratio;

5 Interest Coverage Ratio.

5. 7. 1 Debt-Equity Ratio

Debt—Equity Ratio measures the relationship between long—term debt and
equity. If debt component of the total long-term funds employed is small,
outsiders feel more secure. From security point of view, capital structure
with less debt and more equity is considered favourable as it reduces the
chances of bankruptcy. Normally, it is considered to be safe if debt equity
ratio is 2 : 1. However, it may vary from industry to industry. It is computed
as follows:

Debt— Equity Ratio =

where:
Shareholders' Funds (Equity)

Share capital + Reserves and Surplus +

Money received against share warrants

Equity share capital + Preference share capital
or

Non-current sssets + Working capital

Non-current liabilities

Working Capital = Current Assets Current Liabilities

Share Capital

Shareholders' Funds (Equity)

Signiﬁcance: This ratio measures the degree of indebtedness of an enterprise
and gives an idea to the long—term lender regarding extent of security of the
debt. As indicated earlier, a low debt equity ratio reﬂects more security. A high
ratio, on the other hand, is considered risky as it may put the ﬁrm into diﬂiculty
in meeting its obligations to outsiders. However, from the perspective of the
owners, greater use of debt (trading on equity) may help in ensuring higher
returns for them if the rate of earnings on capital employed is higher than the
rate of interest payable.
