The current ratio is 2 : 1. State giving reasons which of the following transactions
would improve, reduce and not change the current ratio:

(a) Payment of current liability;

(b) Purchased goods on credit;

(c) Sale of a Computer (Book value: Rs. 4,000) for Rs. 3,000 only;

((1) Sale of merchandise (goods) costing Rs. 10,000 for Rs. 1 1 ,000;

(e) Payment of dividend.

Solution:

The given current ratio is 2 : 1. Let us assume that current assets are Rs. 50,000
and current liabilities are Rs. 25,000; Thus, the current ratio is 2 : 1. Now we
will analyse the effect of given transactions on current ratio.

(a) Assume that Rs. 10,000 of creditors is paid by cheque. This will reduce
the current assets to Rs. 40,000 and current liabilities to Rs. 15,000.
The new ratio will be 2.67 : 1 (Rs. 40,000/Rs.15,000). Hence, it has
improved.

(b) Assume that goods of Rs. 10,000 are purchased on credit. This will
increase the current assets to Rs. 60,000 and current liabilities to
Rs. 35,000. The new ratio will be 1.7: 1 (Rs. 60,000/Rs. 35,000). Hence,
it has reduced.

(c) Due to sale of a computer (a fixed asset) the current assets will
increase to Rs. 53,000 without any change in the current liabilities.
The new ratio will be 2.12 : 1 (Rs. 53,000/Rs. 25,000). Hence, it has
improved.

((1) This transaction will decrease the inventories by Rs. 10,000 and
increase the cash by Rs. 1 1,000 thereby increasing the current
assets by Rs. 1,000 without any change in the current liabilities.
The new ratio will be 2.04 : 1 (Rs. 51 ,000/Rs. 25,000). Hence, it has
improved.

(e) Assume that ?5,000 is given by way of dividend. It will reduce the
current assets to ?45,000 and short-term provisions (current liabilities)
by ?5,000. The new ratio will be 2:25: 1 (?45,000/?20,000). Hence, it
has improved.
