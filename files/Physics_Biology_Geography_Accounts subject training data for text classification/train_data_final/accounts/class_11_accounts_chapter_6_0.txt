n the earlier Chapters, you have learnt about the

basic principles of accounting that for every debit
there will be an equal credit. It implies that if the
sum of all debits equals the sum of all credits, it is
presumed that the posting to the ledger in terms
of debit and credit amounts is accurate. The trial
balance is a tool for verifying the correctness of
debit and credit amounts. It is an arithmetical
check under the double entry system which veriﬁes
that both aspects of every transaction have been
recorded accurately. This chapter explains the
meaning and process of preparation of trial balance
and the types of errors and their rectification.

6.1 Meaning of Trial Balance

A trial balance is a statement showing the
balances, or total of debits and credits, of all the
accounts in the ledger with a view to verify the
arithmatical accuracy of posting into the ledger
accounts. Trial balance is an important statement
in the accounting process as it shows the final
position of all accounts and helps in preparing the
final statements. The task of preparing the
statements is simplified because the accountant
can take the balances of all accounts from the trial
balance instead of going through the whole ledger.
It may be noted that the trial balance is usually
prepared with the balances of accounts.
