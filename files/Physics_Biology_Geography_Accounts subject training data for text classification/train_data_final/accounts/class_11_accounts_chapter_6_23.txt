Trial Balance and Rectification of Errors 203

If a transaction is recorded in cash book, then the error in posting relates to the
other affected account, not to cash account/bank account

If a transaction is recorded through journal proper, then the phrase ‘transaction
was not posted’ indicates error in both the accounts involved, unless stated
otherwise.

Error in casting of subsidiary books will affect only that account where total of
the particular book is posted leaving the individual personal accounts unaffected.
