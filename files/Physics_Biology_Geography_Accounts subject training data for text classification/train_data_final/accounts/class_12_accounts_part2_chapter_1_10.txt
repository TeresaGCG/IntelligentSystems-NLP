On Calls : Calls play a vital role in making shares fully paid—up and for realising
the full amount of shares from the shareholders. In the event of shares not being
fully called up till the completion of allotment, the directors have the authority
to ask for the remaining amount on shares as and when they decide about the
same. It is also possible that the timing of the payment of calls by the shareholders
is determined at the time of share issue itself and given in the prospectus.

Two points are important regarding the calls on shares. First, the amount
on any call should not exceed 25% of the face value of shares. Second, there
must be an interval of at least one month between the making of two calls unless
otherwise provided by the articles of association of the company.

When a call is made and the amount of the same is received, the journal
entries are as given below:

1. For Call Amount Due

{Call money due on _Shares @ Rs. per share)
2. For Receipt of Call Amount

(Call money received)

The word /words First, Second, or Third must be added between the words
“Share" and ‘Call' in the Share Call account depending upon the identity of the
call made. For example, in case of first call it will be termed as ‘Share First Call
Account', in case of second call it will be ‘Share Second Call Account' and so on.
