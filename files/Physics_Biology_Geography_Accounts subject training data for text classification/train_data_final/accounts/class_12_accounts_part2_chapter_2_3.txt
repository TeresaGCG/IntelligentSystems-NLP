2.4 Issue of Debentures

The procedure for the issue of debentures is the same as that for the issue of shares.
The intending investors apply for debentures on the basis of the prospectus issued
by the company. The company may either ask for the entire amount to be paid on
application or by means of instalments on application, on allotment and on various
calls. Debentures can be issued at par, at a premium or at a discount. They can
also be issued for consideration other than cash or as a collateral security.
