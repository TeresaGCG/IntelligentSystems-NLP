4. 1 Cash Book

Cash book is a book in which all transactions relating to cash receipts and cash
payments are recorded. It starts with the cash or bank balances at the beginning
of the period. Generally, it is made on monthly basis. This is a very popular
book and is maintained by all organisations, big or small, profit or not-for-
profit. It serves the purpose of both journal as well as the ledger (cash) account.
It is also called the book of original entry. When a cashbook is maintained,
transactions of cash are not recorded in the journal, and no separate account
for cash or bank is required in the ledger.

4.1.1 Single Column Cash Back

The single column cash book records all cash transactions of the business in a
chronological order, i.e., it is a complete record of cash receipts and cash
payments. When all receipts and payments are made in cash by a business
organisation only, the cash book contains only one amount column on each
(debit and credit) side. The format of single column cash book is shown in
figure 4.1.
