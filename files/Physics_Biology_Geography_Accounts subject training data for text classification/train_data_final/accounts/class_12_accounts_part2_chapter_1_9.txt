The combined account is based on the reasoning that allotment without
application is impossible while application without allotment is meaningless.
These two stages of share capital are closely inter-related. When a combined
account is maintained, journal entries are recorded in the following manner:

1. For Receipt of Application and Allotment
Bank A/c Dr.
To Share Application and Allotment A/c
