3.4 Types of Financial Statements

The financial statements generally include two statements: balance sheet and
statement of proﬁt and loss which are required for external reporting and also
for internal needs of the management like planning, decision-making and
control. Apart from these, there is also a need to know about movements of
funds and changes in the ﬁnancial position of the company. For this purpose,
a statement of changes in ﬁnancial position of the company or a cash ﬂow
statement is prepard.

Every company registered under The Companies Act 20 13 shall prepare
its balance sheet, statement of proﬁt and loss and notes to account thereto in
accordance with the manner prescribed in the revised Schedule III to the
Companies Act, 20 13 to harmonise the disclosure requirement with the
accounting standards and to converge with new reforms. With regard to this,
the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) had prescribed a (Revised) Schedule
VI to the Companies Act, 1956 (vide Notification dated 28.02.20 1 1). It is
applied to the ﬁnancial statements prepared for all ﬁnancial periods beginning
on or after April 0 1, 201 1 by the Indian Companies.
