4.4 Tools of Analysis of Financial Statements

1.

Comparative Statements: These are the statements showing the
proﬁtability and ﬁnancial position of a ﬁrm for different periods of time in
a comparative form to give an idea about the position of two or more periods.
It usually applies to the two important financial statements, namely,
balance sheet and statement of proﬁt and loss prepared in a comparative
form. The financial data will be comparative only when same accounting
principles are used in preparing these statements. If this is not the case,
the deviation in the use of accounting principles should be mentioned as
a footnote. Comparative ﬁgures indicate the trend and direction of ﬁnancial
position and operating results. This analysis is also known as ‘horizontal
analysis'.

Common Size Statements: These are the statements which indicate the
relationship of different items of a ﬁnancial statement with a common item
by expressing each item as a percentage of that common item. The
percentage thus calculated can be easily compared with the results of
corresponding percentages of the previous year or of some other ﬁrms, as
the numbers are brought to common base. Such statements also allow an
analyst to compare the operating and ﬁnancing characteristics of two
companies of different sizes in the same industry. Thus, common size
statements are useful, both, in intra—ﬁrm comparisons over different years
and also in making inter-ﬁrm comparisons for the same year or for several
years. This analysis is also known as ‘Vertical analysis'.
