forms have the printed word bearer, which means payment is to be made to the
person whose name has been written after the words “pay” or the bearer of the
cheques. When the world ‘bearer’ is struck off by drawing a line, the cheque
becomes an order cheque. It means payment is to be made to the person whose
name is written on the cheque or to his order after proper identiﬁcation.

Cheques are generally crossed in practice. The payment of a crossed cheque
cannot be made direct to the party on the counter. It is to be paid only through
a bank. When two parallel lines are drawn across the cheque, it is said to be
crossed. The various types of crossing providing different degrees of safety to
the payment are shown in ﬁgure 4.4.
