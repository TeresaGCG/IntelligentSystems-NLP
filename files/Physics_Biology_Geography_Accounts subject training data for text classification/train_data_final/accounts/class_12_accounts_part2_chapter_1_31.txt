1.6.7 Issue of Shares for Consideration other than Cash

There are instances where a company enters into an arrangement with the
vendors from whom it has purchased assets, whereby the latter agrees to accept,
the payment in the form of fully paid shares of the company issued to them.
Normally, no such cash is received for issue of shares. These shares can also be
issued either at par, at premium or at discount, and the number of shares to be
issued will depend upon the price at which the shares are issued and the amount
payable to the vendor. The number of shares to be issued to the vendor will be
calculated as follows:

Number of shares to be issued = Amount Payable
Issue Price

For example, Rahul Limited purchased building from Handa Limited for
Rs.5,40,000 and the payment is to be made by the issue of shares of Rs. 100
each. The number of shares to be issued shall be worked out as follows in different
situations:

(a) When shares are issued at par; Le. at Rs. 100
