Issue and Redemption of Debentures 91

insist on additional assets as collateral security so that the amount of loan can
be realised in full with the help of collateral security in case the amount from the
sale of principal security falls short of the loan money. In such situation, the
company may issue its own debentures to the lenders in addition to some other
assets already pledged. Such an issue of debentures is lmown as ‘Debentures
issued as Collateral Security'.

If the company fails to repay the loan along with interest, the lender is free to
receive his money from the sale of primary security and if the realisable value of
the primary security falls short to cover the entire amount, the lender has the
right to invoke the beneﬁt of collateral security whereby debentures may either
be presented for redemption or sold in the open market.

Debentures issued as collateral security can be dealt within two ways in the
books of the company:

First Method

No entry is made in the books of accounts since no liability is created by such
issue. However, on the liability side of the balance sheet, below the item of loan,
a note to the effect that it has been secured by issue of debentures as a collateral
security is appended. For example, X Company has issued 9%, 10,000
debentures of Rs. 100 each for a loan of Rs. 10, 00,000 taken from a bank. This
fact may be shown in the balance sheet as under:
