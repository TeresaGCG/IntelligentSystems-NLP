Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements

Trend Analysis: It is a technique of studying the operational results and
ﬁnancial position over a series of years. Using the previous years' data of a
business enterprise, trend analysis can be done to observe the percentage
changes over time in the selected data. The trend percentage is the
percentage relationship, in which each item of different years bear to the
same item in the base year. Trend analysis is important because, with its
long run view, it may point to basic changes in the nature of the business.
By looking at a trend in a particular ratio, one may ﬁnd whether the ratio
is falling, rising or remaining relatively constant. From this observation, a
problem is detected or the sign of good or poor management is detected.

Ratio Analysis: It describes the significant relationship which exists
between various items of a balance sheet and a statement of proﬁt and
loss of a ﬁrm. As a technique of ﬁnancial analysis, accounting ratios measure
the comparative signiﬁcance of the individual items of the income and
position statements. It is possible to assess the proﬁtability, solvency and
efﬁciency of an enterprise through the technique of ratio analysis.

Cash Flow Analysis: It refers to the analysis of actual movement of cash
into and out of an organisation. The ﬂow of cash into the business is called
as cash inﬂow or positive cash ﬂow and the ﬂow of cash out of the ﬁrm is
called as cash outﬂow or a negative cash ﬂow. The difference between the
inﬂow and outﬂow of cash is the net cash ﬂow. Cash ﬂow statement is
prepared to project the manner in which the cash has been received and
has been utilised during an accounting year as it shows the sources of
cash receipts and also the purposes for which payments are made. Thus,
it summarises the causes for the changes in cash position of a business
enterprise between dates of two balance sheets.
