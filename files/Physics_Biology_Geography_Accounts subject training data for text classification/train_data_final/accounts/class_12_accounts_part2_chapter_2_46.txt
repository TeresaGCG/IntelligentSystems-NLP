1 1 8 Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements

debentures are termed as redemption by purchase in the open market. The
advantage of such an option is that a company can redeem the debentures at its
convenience whenever it has surplus funds. Secondly, the company can purchase
them when they are available in market at a discount.

When the debentures are purchased from the market at a discount and
cancelled, the journal entries are recorded as follows :

1. On purchase of own debentures for immediate cancellation
Debentures A/c Dr.
To Bank A/c

To Proﬁt on Redemption of Debentures A/c
2. On transfer of Proﬁt on Redemption
Proﬁt on Redemption of Debenture A/c Dr.
To Capital Reserve

In case, the debentures are purchased from the market at a price which is above
the nominal value of debenture, the excess will be debited to loss on redemption
of debentures. The journal entry in that case will be

1. Debentures A/c Dr.
Loss on Redemption of Debentures A/c Dr.

To Bank A/c
2. Statement of proﬁt and loss Dr.

To Loss on Redemption of Debentures A/c
