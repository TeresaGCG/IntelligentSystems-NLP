2.5 Over Subscription

When the number of debentures applied for is more than the number of
debentures offered to the public. the issue is said to be over subscribed. A
company, however, cannot allot more debentures than it has invited for
subscription. The excess money received on over subscription may, however, be
retained for adjustment towards allotment and the respective calls to be made.
But the money received from applicants to whom no debentures have been
allotted, will be refunded to them.
