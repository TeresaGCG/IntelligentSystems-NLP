2.4.2 Issue of Debentures at a Discount

When a debenture is issued at a price below its nominal value, it is said to be
issued at a discount. For example, the issue of Rs. 100 debentures at Rs. 95,
Rs. 5 being the amount of discount. Discount on issue of debentures is a capital
loss and is shown under the line item ‘Other Non-Current Assets' or ‘Other
Current Assets’ depending upon the time period in which it is to be written off.
The discount on issue of debentures can be written off either by debiting it to
Statement of Proﬁt and Loss or out of Securities Premium Reserve A/c, if any,
during the life time of debentures.

Discount on issue of debentures to be written off within 12 months of the
balance sheet date or the period of operating cycle is shown under ‘Other Current
Assets' and the part which is to be written off after 12 months of balance sheet is
shown under ‘Other Non-Current Assets'.

The Companies Act, 2013 does not impose any restrictions upon the issue

of debentures at a discount.
