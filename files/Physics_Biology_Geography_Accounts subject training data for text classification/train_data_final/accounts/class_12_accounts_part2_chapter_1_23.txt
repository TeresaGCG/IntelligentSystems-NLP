Third Alternative :When the application for some shares are rejected outrightly;
and pro-rata allotment is made to the remaining applicants, the money on rejected
applications is refunded and the excess application money received from
applicants to whom pro—rata allotment has been made is adjusted towards the
amount due on the allotment of shares allotted.

For example, a company invited applications for 10,000 shares and received
applications for 15,000 shares. The directors decided to reject the applications
for 2,500 shares outright and to make a pro-rata allotment of 10,000 shares to
the applicants for the remaining 12,500 shares so that four shares are allotted
for every five shares applied. In this case, the money on applications for 2,500
shares rejected would be refunded fully and that on the remaining 2,500 shares
(12,500 shares — 10,000 shares) would be adjusted against the allotment amount
due on 10,000 shares allotted and credited to share allotment account, the
journal entries on application and allotment recorded as follows:
