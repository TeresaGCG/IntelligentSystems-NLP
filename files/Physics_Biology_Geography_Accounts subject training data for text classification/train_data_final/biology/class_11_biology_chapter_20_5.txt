LOCOMOT ION AND MOVEMENT

 

Muscle contraction is initiated by a signal sent by the central nervous
system (CNS) via a motor neuron. A motor neuron alongwith the muscle
ﬁbres connected to it constitute a motor unit. The junction between a
motor neuron and the sarcolemma of the muscle ﬁbre is called the
neuromuscular junction or motor-end plate. A neural signal reaching
this j unction releases a neurotransmitter (Acetyl choline) which generates
an action potential in the sarcolemma. This spreads through the muscle
ﬁbre and causes the release of calcium ions into the sarcoplasm. Increase
in CaH level leads to the binding of calcium with a subunit of troponin on
actin ﬁlaments and thereby remove the masking of active sites for myosin.
Utilising the energy from ATP hydrolysis, the myosin head now binds to
the exposed active sites on actin to form a cross bridge (Figure 20.4). This

pulls the attached actin ﬁlaments towards the centre of ‘A’ band. The
‘2’ line attached to these actins are also pulled inwards thereby causing a
shortening of the sarcomere, i.e., contraction. It is clear from the above
steps, that during shortening of the muscle, i.e., contraction, the ‘1’ bands
get reduced, whereas the ‘A’ bands retain the length (Figure 20.5). The
myosin, releasing the ADP and P1 goes back to its relaxed state. A new
ATP binds and the cross-bridge is broken (Figure 20.4). The ATP is again
hydrolysed by the myosin head and the cycle of cross bridge formation
