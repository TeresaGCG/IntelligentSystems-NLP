of the nucellus. It is a large cell containing dense cytoplasm and a
prominent nucleus. The MMC undergoes meiotic division. What is the
importance of the MMC undergoing meiosis? Meiosis results in the

production of four megaspores (Figure 2.8a).
Female gametophyte : In a majority of ﬂowering plants, one of the
—

megaspores is functional While the other three degenerate. Only the
functional megaspore develops into the female gametophyte (embryo
sac). This method of embryo sac formation from a single megaspore is termed
monosporic development. What will be the ploidy of the cells of the nucellus,
MMC, the ﬁmctional megaspore and female gametophyte?
