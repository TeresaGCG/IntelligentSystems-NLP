lie close to each other so that self-pollination
can occur. Some plants such as Viola
(common pansy), Oxalis, and Commelina
produce two types of flowers —
chasmogamous ﬂowers which are similar to
ﬂowers of other species with exposed anthers
and stigma, and Cleistogamous ﬂowers which
do not open at all (Figure 2.9c). In such ﬂowers,
the anthers and stigma lie close to each other.
When anthers dehisce in the ﬂower buds,
pollen grains come in contact with the stigma
to effect pollination. Thus, Cleistogamous
ﬂowers are invariably autogamous as there is
no chance of cross-pollen landing on the
stigma. Cleistogamous ﬂowers produce
assured seed-set even in the absence of
pollinators. Do you think that cleistogamy is
advantageous or disadvantageous to the
plant? Why?

Geitonogamy- Transfer of pollen grains from
the anther to the stigma of another ﬂower of
the same plant. Although geitonogamy is
functionally cross-pollination involving a
pollinating agent, genetically it is similar to
autogamy since the pollen grains come from
the same plant.

Xenogamy - Transfer of pollen grains from
anther to the stigma of a different plant (Figure
2.9b). This is the only type of pollination which
during pollination brings genetically different
types of pollen grains to the stigma.

Agents of Pollination : Plants use two abiotic (wind
and water) and one biotic (animals) agents to achieve
pollination. Majority of plants use biotic agents for
pollination. Only a small proportion of plants use
abiotic agents. Pollen grains coming in contact with
the stigma is a chance factor in both wind and water
pollination. To compensate for this uncertainties and
associated loss of pollen grains, the ﬂowers produce

enormous amount of pollen when compared to the

number of ovules available for pollination.
