RESPIRATION IN PLANTS

carbohydrates. Sucrose is converted into glucose
and fructose by the enzyme, invertase, and these
two monosaccharides readily enter the glycolytic
pathway. Glucose and fructose are
phosphorylated to give rise to glucose-6-
phosphate by the activity of the enzyme
hexokinase. This phosphorylated form of glucose
then isomerises to produce fructose-6-
phosphate. Subsequent steps of metabolism of
glucose and ﬁ‘uctose are same. The various steps
of glycolysis are depicted in Figure 14.1. In
glycolysis, a chain of ten reactions, under the
control of different enzymes, takes place to
produce pyruvate from glucose. While studying
the steps of glycolysis, please note the steps at
which utilisation or synthesis of AT P or (in this
case) NADH + H+ take place.

ATP is utilised at two steps: ﬁrst in the
conversion of glucose into glucose 6-phosphate
and second in the conversion of fructose
6-phosphate to fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate.

The fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate is split
into dihydroxyacetone phosphate and
3-phosphoglyceraldehyde (PGAL). We find
that there is one step where NADH + H+ is
formed from NAD+; this is when
3-phosphoglyceraldehyde (PGAL) is converted
to 1, 3-bisphosphoglycerate (BPGA). Two
redox—equivalents are removed (in the form of
two hydrogen atoms) from PGAL and transferred
to a molecule of NAD+. PGAL is oxidised and
with inorganic phosphate to get converted into
BPGA. The conversion of BPGA to
3-phosphoglyceric acid (PGA), is also an energy
yielding process; this energy is trapped by the
formation of ATP. Another ATP is synthesised
during the conversion of PEP to pyruvic acid.
Can you then calculate how many ATP
molecules are directly synthesised in this
pathway from one glucose molecule?

Pyruvic acid is then the key product of
glycolysis. What is the metabolic fate of
pyruvate? This depends on the cellular need.
