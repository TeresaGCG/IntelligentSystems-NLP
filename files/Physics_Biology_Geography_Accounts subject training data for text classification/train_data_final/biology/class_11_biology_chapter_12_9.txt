Figure 12.4 Development of root nodules in soyabean : (a) Rhizobium bacteria
contact a susceptible root hair, divide near it, (b) Successful infection
of the root hair causes it to curl, (c) Infected thread carries the bacteria
to the inner cortex. The bacteria get modified into rod-shaped
bacteroids and cause inner cortical and pericycle cells to divide.
Division and growth of cortical and pericycle cells lead to nodule
formation, (d) A mature nodule is complete with vascular tissues
continuous with those of the root

The reaction is as follows:

N2 +8e +8H++16ATP—>2Nﬁ +H ﬁBADP+E£&

The enzyme nitrogenase is highly sensitive to the molecular oxygen; it
requires anaerobic conditions. The nodules have adaptations that ensure
that the enzyme is protected from oxygen. To protect these enzymes, the
nodule contains an oxygen scavenger called leg-haemoglobin. It is interesting
to note that these microbes live as aerobes under ﬁ‘ee-living conditions (Where
nitrogenase is not operational), but during nitrogen-ﬁxing events, they become
anaerobic (thus protecting the nitrogenase enzyme). You must have noticed
in the above reaction that the ammonia synthesis by nitrogenease requires a
