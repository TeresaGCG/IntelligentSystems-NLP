Radioactive phages were allowed to attach to E. coli bacteria. Then, as
the infection proceeded, the viral coats were removed from the bacteria by
agitating them in a blender. The virus particles were separated from the
bacteria by spinning them in a centrifuge.

Bacteria which was infected with Viruses that had radioactive DNA
were radioactive, indicating that DNA was the material that passed from
the virus to the bacteria. Bacteria that were infected with viruses that had
radioactive proteins were not radioactive. This indicates that proteins did
not enter the bacteria from the viruses. DNA is therefore the genetic
material that is passed from virus to bacteria (Figure 6.5).

From the foregoing discussion, it is clear that the debate between proteins
versus DNA as the genetic material was unequivocally resolved from
Hershey-Chase experiment. It became an established fact that it is DNA
that acts as genetic material. However, it subsequently became clear that
