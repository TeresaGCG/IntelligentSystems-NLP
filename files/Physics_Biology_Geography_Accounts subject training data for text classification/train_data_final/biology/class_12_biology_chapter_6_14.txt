MOLECULAR BASIS OF INHERITANCE

deﬁne a gene in terms of DNA sequence. The DNA sequence coding for
tRNA or rRNA molecule also deﬁne a gene. However by deﬁning a cistron
as a segment of DNA coding for a polypeptide, the structural gene in a
transcription unit could be said as monocistronic (mostly in eukaryotes)
or polycistronic (mostly in bacteria or prokaryotes). In eukaryotes, the
monocistronic structural genes have interrupted coding sequences — the
genes in eukaryotes are split. The coding sequences or expressed
sequences are deﬁned as exons. Exons are said to be those sequence
that appear in mature or processed RNA. The exons are interrupted by
introns. Introns or intervening sequences do not appear in mature or
processed RNA. The split-gene arrangement further complicates the
deﬁnition of a gene in terms of a DNA segment.

Inheritance of a character is also affected by promoter and regulatory
sequences of a structural gene. Hence, sometime the regulatory sequences
are loosely deﬁned as regulatory genes, even though these sequences do
not code for any RNA or protein.

6.5.3 Types of RNA and the process of Transcription

In bacteria, there are three major types of RNAs: mRNA (messenger RNA),
tRNA (transfer RNA), and rRNA (ribosomal RNA). All three RNAs are
needed to synthesise a protein in a cell. The mRNA provides the template,
tRNA brings aminoacids and reads the genetic code, and rRNAs play
structural and catalytic role during translation. There is single
DNA-dependent RNA polymerase that catalyses transcription of all types
of RNA in bacteria. RNA polymerase binds to promoter and initiates
transcription (Initiation). It uses nucleoside triphosphates as substrate
