acid. The first amino acid is also
called as N-terminal amino acid. The
last amino acid is called the C-
terminal amino acid. A protein
thread does not exist throughout as
an extended rigid rod. The thread is
folded in the form of a helix (similar
to a revolving staircase). Of course,
only some portions of the protein
thread are arranged in the form of a
helix. In proteins, only right handed
helices are observed. Other regions
of the protein thread are folded into
other forms in what is called the
secondary structure. In addition,
the long protein chain is also folded
upon itself like a hollow woolen ball,
giving rise to the tertiary structure
(Figure 9.4 a, b). This gives us a 3-
dimensional view of a protein.
Tertiary structure is absolutely
necessary for the many biological
activities of proteins.

Some proteins are an assembly
of more than one polypeptide or
subunits. The manner in which
these individual folded polypeptides
or subunits are arranged with
respect to each other (e. g. linear
string of spheres, spheres arranged
one upon each other in the form of
a cube or plate etc.) is the
architecture of a protein otherwise
called the quaternary structure of
a protein. Adult human
haemoglobin consists of 4 subunits.
Two of these are identical to each
other. Hence, two subunits of 0c type
and two subunits of B type together
constitute the human haemoglobin
(Hb).
