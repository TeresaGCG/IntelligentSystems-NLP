DNA from crime scene (C) Ampliﬁed repeats,separated by size

on a gel, give a DNA ﬁngerprint

Figure 6.16 Schematic representation of DNA fingerprinting: Few representative chromosomes
have been shown to contain different copy number of VNTR. For the sake of
understanding different colour schemes have been used to trace the origin of each
band in the gel. The two alleles (paternal and maternal) of a chromosome also
contain different copy numbers of VNTR. It is clear that the banding pattern of DNA
from crime scene matches with individual B, and not with A.

science, it has much wider application, such as in determining
population and genetic diversities. Currently, many different probes
are used to generate DNA fingerprints.
