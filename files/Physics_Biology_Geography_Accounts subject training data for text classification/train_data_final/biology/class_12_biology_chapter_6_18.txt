MOLECULAR BASIS OF INHERITANCE

Now try the opposite. Following is the sequence of amino acids coded
by an mRNA. Predict the nucleotide sequence in the RIVA:

Met-Phe-Phe-Phe-Phe-Phe-Phe
Do you face any difﬁculty in predicting the opposite?

Can you now correlate which two properties of genetic code you have
learnt?

6.6. 1 Mutations and Genetic Code

The relationships between genes and DNA are best understood by mutation
studies. You have studied about mutation and its effect in Chapter 5. Effects
of large deletions and rearrangements in a segment of DNA are easy to
comprehend. It may result in loss or gain of a gene and so a function. The
effect of point mutations will be explained here. A classical example of
point mutation is a change of single base pair in the gene for beta globin
chain that results in the change of amino acid residue glutamate to valine.
It results into a diseased condition called as sickle cell anemia. Effect of
point mutations that inserts or deletes a base in structural gene can be
better understood by following simple example.

Consider a statement that is made up of the following words each
having three letters like genetic code.

RAM HAS RED CAP

If we insert a letter B in between HAS and RED and rearrange the
statement, it would read as follows:

RAMHASBREDCAP

Similarly, if we now insert two letters at the same place, say BI'. Now it
would read,

RAM HAS BIR EDC AP
Now we insert three letters together, say BIG, the statement would read
RAM HAS BIG RED CAP

The same exercise can be repeated, by deleting the letters R, E and D,
one by one and rearranging the statement to make a triplet word.

RAM HAS EDC AP
RAM HAS DCA P
RAMHAS CAP

The conclusion from the above exercise is very obvious. Insertion or
deletion of one or two bases changes the reading frame from the point of
insertion or deletion. However, such mutations are referred to as
