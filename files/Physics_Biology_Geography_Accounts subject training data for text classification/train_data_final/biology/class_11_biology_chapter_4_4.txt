4.2.2 Phylum - Coelenterata (Cnidaria)

They are aquatic, mostly marine, sessile or free-swimming, radially
symmetrical animals (Figure 4.6). The name cnidaria is derived from the

cnidoblasts or cnidocytes (which contain the stinging capsules or
nematocysts) present on the tentacles and the body. Cnidoblasts are used
for anchorage, defense and for the capture of prey (Figure 4.7). Cnidarians
exhibit tissue level of organisation and are diploblastic. They have a central
gastro-vascular cavity with a single opening, mouth on hypostome.
Digestion is extracellular and intracellular. Some of the cnidarians, e. g.,
corals have a skeleton composed of calcium carbonate. Cnidarians exhibit
two basic body forms called polyp and medusa (Figure 4.6). The former
is a sessile and cylindrical form like Hydra, Adamsia, etc. whereas, the
latter is umbrella-shaped and free-swimming like Aurelia or jelly ﬁsh.
Those cnidarians which exist in both forms exhibit alternation of
generation (Metagenesis), i.e., polyps produce medusae asexually and
medusae form the polyps sexually (e. g., Obelia).

Examples: Physalia (Portuguese man-of—war), Adamsia (Sea anemone),
Pennatula (Sea-pen), Gorgonia (Sea-fan) and Meandrina (Brain coral).
