22.2 HUMAN ENDOCRINE SYSTEM

   
  
  
  
 

The endocrine glands and hormone
producing diffused tissues / cells located
in different parts of our body constitute
the endocrine system. Pituitary, pineal,
ThYIOid and thyroid, adrenal, pancreas, parathyroid,
Parathymid thymus and gonads (testis in males and
ovary in females) are the organised
Thymus endocrine bodies in our body
Wigure 22.1). In addition to these, some
other organs, e. g., gastrointestinal tract,
liver, kidney, heart also produce
hormones. A brief account of the
Adrenal structure and functions of all major
endocrine glands and hypothalamus
of the human body is given in the
following sections.

Testis 22.2. 1 The Hypothalamus

As you know, the hypothalamus is the
basal part of diencephalon, forebrain
(Figure 22.1) and it regulates a wide
spectrum of body functions. It contains
several groups of neurosecretory cells
called nuclei which produce hormones.
These hormones regulate the synthesis and secretion of pituitary
hormones. However, the hormones produced by hypothalamus are of
two types, the releasing hormones (which stimulate secretion of pituitary
hormones) and the inhibiting hormones (which inhibit secretions of
pituitary hormones). For example a hypothalamic hormone called
Gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulates the pituitary
synthesis and release of gonadotrophins. On the other hand, somatostatin
from the hypothalamus inhibits the release of grth hormone from the
pituitary. These hormones originating in the hypothalamic neurons, pass
through axons and are released from their nerve endings. These hormones
reach the pituitary gland through a portal circulatory system and regulate
the functions of the anterior pituitary. The posterior pituitary is under

the direct neural regulation of the hypothalamus (Figure 22.2).
