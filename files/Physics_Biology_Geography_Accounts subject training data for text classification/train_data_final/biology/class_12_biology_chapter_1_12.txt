In diploid organisms, specialised cells called meiocytes (gamete mother
cell) undergo meiosis. At the end of meiosis, only one set of chromosomes
gets incorporated into each gamete. Carefully study Table 1.1 and ﬁll in
the diploid and haploid chromosome numbers of organisms. Is there any
relationship in the number of chromosomes of meiocytes and gametes?

1.2.1.2 Gamete Transfer

After their formation, male and female gametes must be physically

brought together to facilitate fusion (fertilisation). Have you ever

wondered how the gametes meet? In a majority of organisms, male

gamete is motile and the female gamete is stationary. Exceptions are a

few fungi and algae in which both types of gametes are motile

(Figure1.7a). There is a need for a medium through which the male -I 3
gametes move. In several simple plants like algae, bryophytes and
pteridophytes, water is the medium through which this gamete transfer
takes place. A large number of the male gametes, however, fail to reach
the female gametes. To compensate this loss of male gametes during
transport, the number of male gametes produced is several thousand
times the number of female gametes produced.
