turn. Consequently, the distance
between a bp in a helix is
approximately 0.34 nm.

(v) The plane of one base pair stacks
over the other in double helix. This,
in addition to H-bonds, confers
stability of the helical structure
(Figure 6.3).

Compare the structure of purines and
pyrimidines. Can you find out why the
distance between two polynucleotide
chains in DNA remains almost constant?

The proposition of a double helix
structure for DNA and its simplicity in
explaining the genetic implication became
revolutionary. Very soon, Francis Crick
proposed the Central dogma in molecular
biology, which states that the genetic
information ﬂows from DNAéRNA9Protein.
