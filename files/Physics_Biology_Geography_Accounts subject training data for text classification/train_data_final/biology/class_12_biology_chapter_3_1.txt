HUMAN REPRODUCTION

’Ihe testes are situated outside the
abdominal cavity within a pouch
called scrotum. The scrotum helps
in maintaining the low temperature
of the testes (2—2.5° C lower than
the normal internal body
temperature) necessary for
spermatogenesis. In adults, each
testis is oval in shape, with a length
of about 4 to 5 cm and a width of
about 2 to 3 cm. The testis is
covered by a dense covering. Each
testis has about 250 compartments
called testicular lobules
(Figure 3.1b).

Each lobule contains one to
three highly coiled seminiferous
tubules in which sperms are
produced. Each seminiferous tubule
is lined on its inside by two types
of cells called male germ cells
(spermatogonia) and Sertoli cells
(Figure 3.2 ). The male germ cells
undergo meiotic divisions ﬁnally
leading to sperm formation, while
Sertoli cells provide nutrition to the
germ cells. The regions outside the
seminiferous tubules called
interstitial spaces, contain small
blood vessels and interstitial cells
or Leydig cells (Figure 3.2). Leydig
cells synthesise and secrete
testicular hormones called
androgens. Other immunologically
competent cells are also present.

The male sex accessory ducts include rete testis, vasa efferentia,
epididymis and vas deferens (Figure 3.1b). The seminiferous tubules of
the testis open into the vasa elferentia through rete testis. The vasa efferentia

of each testis. The epididymis leads to vas deferens that ascends to the
abdomen and loops over the urinary bladder. It receives a duct from seminal
vesicle and opens into urethra as the ejaculatory duct (Figure 3.1a). These
ducts store and transport the sperms from the testis to the outside through
urethra. The urethra originates from the urinary bladder and extends
through the penis to its external opening called urethral meatus.
