glued to a suitable surface, usually in a crack or crevice of high relative
humidity near a food source. On an average, females produce 9- 10
oothecae, each containing 14- 16 eggs. The development of P. americana
is paurometabolous, meaning there is development through nymphal
stage. The nymphs look very much like adults. The nymph grows by
moulting about 13 times to reach the adult form. The next to last nymphal
stage has wing pads but only adult cockroaches have wings.

Many species of cockroaches are wild and are of no known economic
importance yet. A few species thrive in and around human habitat. They are
pests because they spoil food and contaminate it with their smelly excreta.
They can transmit avarlety of bacterial diseases by contaminating food material.
