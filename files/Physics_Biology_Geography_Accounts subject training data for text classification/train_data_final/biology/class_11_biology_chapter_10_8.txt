Figure 10.4 Stages of Meiosis II

Telophase II: Meiosis ends with telophase II, in which the two
groups of chromosomes once again get enclosed by a nuclear
envelope; cytokinesis follows resulting in the formation of tetrad
of cells i.e., four haploid daughter cells (Figure 10.4).

10.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF MEIOSIS

Meiosis is the mechanism by which conservation of speciﬁc
chromosome number of each species is achieved across
generations in sexually reproducing organisms, even though the
process, per se, paradoxically, results in reduction of chromosome
number by half. It also increases the genetic variability in the
population of organisms from one generation to the next. Variations
are very important for the process of evolution.

SUMMARY

According to the cell theory, cells arise from preexisting cells. The process by
which this occurs is called cell division. Any sexually reproducing organism
starts its life cycle from a single-celled zygote. Cell division does not stop with
the formation of the mature organism but continues throughout its life cycle.
