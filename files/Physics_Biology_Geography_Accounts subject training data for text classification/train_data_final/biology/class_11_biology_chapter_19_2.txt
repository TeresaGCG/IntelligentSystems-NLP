medullary pyramids as renal columns called
Columns of Bertini (Figure 19.2).

Each kidney has nearly one million
complex tubular structures called nephrons
Wigure 19.3), which are the functional units.
Each nephron has two parts — the
glomerulus and the renal tubule.
Glomerulus is a tuft of capillaries formed by
the afferent arteriole — a ﬁne branch of renal
artery. Blood from the glomerulus is carried
away by an efferent arteriole.

The renal tubule begins with a double
walled cup-like structure called Bowman’s
capsule, which encloses the glomerulus.
Glomerulus alongwith Bowman’s capsule, is
called the malpighian body or renal
corpuscle (Figure 19.4). The tubule
continues further to form a highly coiled
network — proximal convoluted tubule
