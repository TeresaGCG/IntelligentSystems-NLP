oocyte. Can you think of any advantage vessels " ' - ..‘r""":" ﬁgiﬁfcllin
for this? Does the first polar body born

out of ﬁrst meiotic division divide further
or degenerate? At present we are not
very certain about this. The tertiary
follicle further changes into the mature
follicle or Graafian follicle (Figure 3.7).
The secondary oocyte forms a new
membrane called zona pellucida
surrounding it. The Graaﬁan follicle now
ruptures to release the secondary oocyte
(ovum) from the ovary by the
process called ovulation. Can you Figure 3.7 Diagrammatic Section View of ovary

spermatogenesis and oogenesis? A diagrammatic representation of

spermatogenesis and oogenesis is given below (Figure 3.8).

3.4 MENSTRUAL CYCLE
The reproductive cycle in the female primates (e. g. monkeys, apes and _
—

human beings) is called menstrual cycle. The ﬁrst menstruation begins
at puberty and is called menarche. In human females, menstruation

is repeated at an average interval of about 28/29 days, and the cycle of
events starting from one menstruation till the next one is called the

menstrual cycle. One ovum is released (ovulation) during the middle
