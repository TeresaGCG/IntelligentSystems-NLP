Based on his observations on monohybrid crosses Mendel proposed
two general rules to consolidate his understanding of inheritance in
monohybrid crosses. Today these rules are called the Principles or
Laws of Inheritance: the First Law or Law of Dominance and the
Second Law or Law of Segregation.

5.2. 1 Law of Dominance

(1) Characters are controlled by discrete units called factors.
(ii) Factors occur in pairs.

(iii) In a dissimilar pair of factors one member of the pair dominates
(dominant) the other (recessive).

The law of dominance is used to explain the expression of only one of
the parental characters in a monohybrid cross in the F1 and the expression
of both in the F2. It also explains the proportion of 3: 1 obtained at the F2.

5.2.2 Law of Segregation

This law is based on the fact that the alleles do not show any blending
and that both the characters are recovered as such in the F2 generation
though one of these is not seen at the F1 stage. Though the parents contain
two alleles during gamete formation, the factors or alleles of a pair segregate
from each other such that a gamete receives only one of the two factors.
Of course, a homozygous parent produces all gametes that are similar
while a heterozygous one produces two kinds of gametes each having
one allele with equal proportion.
