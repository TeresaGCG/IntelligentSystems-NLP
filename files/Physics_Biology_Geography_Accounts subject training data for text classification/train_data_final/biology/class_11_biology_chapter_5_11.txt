gamopetalous (petals united) or polypetalous (petals free). The shape
and colour of corolla vary greatly in plants. Corolla may be tubular, bell-
shaped, funnel-shaped or Wheel-shaped.

Aestivation: The mode of arrangement of sepals or petals in ﬂoral bud
with respect to the other members of the same whorl is known as
aestivation. The main types of aestivation are valvate, twisted, imbricate
and vexillary (Figure 5.15). When sepals or petals in a whorl just touch
one another at the margin, without overlapping, as in Calotropis, it is
said to be valvate. If one margin of the appendage overlaps that of the
next one and so on as in china rose, lady’s ﬁnger and cotton, it is called
twisted. If the margins of sepals or petals overlap one another but not in
any particular direction as in Cassia and gulmohur, the aestivation is
called imbricate. In pea and bean ﬂowers, there are ﬁve petals, the largest
(standard) overlaps the two lateral petals (wings) which in turn overlap
the two smallest anterior petals (keel); this type of aestivation is known
as vexillary or papilionaceous.
