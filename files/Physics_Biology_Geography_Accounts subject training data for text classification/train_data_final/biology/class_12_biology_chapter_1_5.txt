Many single-celled organisms reproduce by binary fission, where a
cell divides into two halves and each rapidly grows into an adult (e. g.,
Amoeba, Paramecium). In yeast, the division is unequal and small
buds are produced that remain attached initially to the parent cell
which, eventually gets separated and mature into new yeast
organisms (cells). Under unfavourable condition the Amoeba withdraws
its pseudopodia and secretes a three-layered hard covering or cyst
around itself. This phenomenon is termed as encystation. When
favourable conditions return, the encysted Amoeba divides by multiple
fission and produces many minute amoeba or pseudopodiospores;
the cyst wall bursts out, and the spores are liberated in the surrounding
medium to grow up into many amoebae. This phenomenon is
known as sporulation.
