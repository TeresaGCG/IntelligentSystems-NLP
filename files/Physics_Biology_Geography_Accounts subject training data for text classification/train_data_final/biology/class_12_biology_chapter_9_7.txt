by testing the materials in farmers’ ﬁelds, for at least three growing
seasons at several locations in the country, representing all the
agroclimatic zones Where the crop is usually grown. The material is
evaluated in comparison to the best available local crop cultivar — a
check or reference cultivar.

India is mainly an agricultural country. Agriculture accounts
for approximately 33 per cent of India’s GDP and employs nearly
62 per cent of the population. After India’s independence, one of the main
challenges facing the country was that of producing enough food for the
increasing population. As only limited land is ﬁt for cultivation, India has
to strive to increase yields per unit area from em'sting farm land. The
development of several high yielding varieties of Wheat and rice in the
mid- 1960s, as a result of various plant breeding techniques led to dramatic
increase in food production in our country. This phase is often referred
to as the Green Revolution. Figure 9.3 represents some Indian hybrid
crops of high yeilding varieties.
