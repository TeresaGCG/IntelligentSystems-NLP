part of the oviduct called ampulla. The last part of the oviduct, isthmus has
a narrow lumen and it joins the uterus.

The uterus is single and it is also called womb. The shape of the uterus
is like an inverted pear. It is supported by ligaments attached to the pelvic
wall. The uterus opens into vagina through a narrow cervix. The cavity of
the cervix is called cervical canal (Figure 3.3b) which alongwith vagina
forms the birth canal. The wall of the uterus has three layers of tissue. The
external thin membranous perimetrium, middle thick layer of smooth
muscle, myometrium and inner glandular layer called endometrium that
lines the uterine cavity. The endometrium undergoes cyclical changes during
menstrual cycle while the myometrium exhibits strong contraction during
delivery of the baby.

The female external genitalia include mons pubis, labia majora, labia
minora, hymen and clitoris (Figure 3.3a). Mons pubis is a cushion of fatty
tissue covered by skin and pubic hair. The labia majora are ﬂeshy folds of
tissue, which extend down from the mons pubis and surround the vaginal
opening. The labia minora are paired folds of tissue under the labia majora.
The opening of the vagina is often covered partially by a membrane called
hymen. The clitoris is a tiny ﬁnger-er structure which lies at the upper
junction of the two labia minora above the urethral opening. The hymen is
often torn during the ﬁrst coitus (intercourse). However, it can also be broken
by a sudden fall or jolt, insertion of a vaginal tampon, active participation
in some sports like horseback riding, cycling, etc. In some women the hymen
persists even aﬁer coitus. In fact, the presence or absence of hymen is not
a reliable indicator of virginity or sexual experience.
