BIOLOGY

physiological functions are regulated by hormones. On the basis of their
chemical nature, hormones can be divided into groups :
(i) peptide, polypeptide, protein hormones (e.g., insulin, glucagon,
pituitary hormones, hypothalamic hormones, etc.)
(ii) steroids (e.g., cortisol, testosterone, estradiol and progesterone)
(iii) iodothyronines (thyroid hormones)
(iv) amino-acid derivatives (e.g., epinephrine).

Hormones which interact with membrane-bound receptors normally
do not enter the target cell, but generate second messengers (e. g., cyclic
AMP, 1P3, Ca“ etc) which in turn regulate cellular metabolism (Figure
22.5a). Hormones which interact with intracellular receptors (e. g., steroid
hormones, iodothyronines, etc.) mostly regulate gene expression or
chromosome function by the interaction of hormone-receptor complex
with the genome. Cumulative biochemical actions result in physiological
and developmental effects (Figure 22.5b).
