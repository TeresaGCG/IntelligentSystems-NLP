of the nematode. The consequence was that the parasite could not survive
in a transgenic host expressing speciÔ¨Åc interfering RNA. The transgenic
plant therefore got itself protected from the parasite (Figure 12.2).

12.2 BIOTECHNOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS IN MEDICINE

The recombinant DNA technological processes have made immense impact
in the area of healthcare by enabling mass production of safe and more
effective therapeutic drugs. Further, the recombinant therapeutics do not
induce unwanted immunological responses as is common in case of
similar products isolated from non-human sources. At present, about
30 recombinant therapeutics have been approved for human-use the
world over. In India, 12 of these are presently being marketed.

12.2. 1 Genetically Engineered Insulin

Management of adult-onset diabetes is possible by taking insulin at
regular time intervals. What would a diabetic patient do if enough
human-insulin was not available? If you discuss this, you would soon
realise that one would have to isolate and use insulin from other animals.
Would the insulin isolated from other animals be just as effective as
that secreted by the human body itself and would it not elicit an immune
response in the human body? Now, imagine if bacterium were available
that could make human insulin. Suddenly the whole process becomes
so simple. You can easily grow a large quantity of the bacteria and make
as much insulin as you need.

Think about whether insulin can be orally administered to diabetic
people or not. Why?
