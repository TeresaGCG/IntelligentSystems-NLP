CHAPTER 2 1

NEURAL CONTROL AND

COORDINATION

As you know, the functions of the organs / organ systems in our body
must be coordinated to maintain homeostasis. Coordination is the
process through which two or more organs interact and complement the
functions of one another. For example, when we do physical exercises,
the energy demand is increased for maintaining an increased muscular
activity. The supply of oxygen is also increased. The increased supply of
oxygen necessitates an increase in the rate of respiration, heart beat and
increased blood ﬂow via blood vessels. When physical exercise is stopped,
the activities of nerves, lungs, heart and kidney gradually return to their
normal conditions. Thus, the functions of muscles, lungs, heart, blood
vessels, kidney and other organs are coordinated while performing physical
exercises. In our body the neural system and the endocrine system jointly
coordinate and integrate all the activities of the organs so that they function
in a synchronised fashion.

The neural system provides an organised network of point-to-point
connections for a quick coordination. The endocrine system provides
chemical integration through hormones. In this chapter, you will learn
about the neural system of human, mechanisms of neural coordination
like transmission of nerve impulse, impulse conduction across a synapse
and the physiology of reﬂex action.
