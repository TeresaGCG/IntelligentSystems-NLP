NEURAL CONTROL AND COORDINATION

Sense Organs

We smell things by our nose, taste by tongue, hear by ear and see objects
by eyes.

The nose contains mucus-coated receptors which are specialised for
receiving the sense of smell and called olfactory receptors. These are
made up of olfactory epithelium that consists of three kinds of cells. The
neurons of the olfactory epithelium extend from the outside environment
directly into a pair of broad bean-sized organs, called olfactory bulb,
which are extensions of the brain’s limbic system.

Both nose and tongue detect dissolved chemicals. The chemical senses
of gustation (taste) and olfactory (smell) are functionally similar and
interrelated. The tongue detects tastes through taste buds, containing
gustatory receptors. With each taste of food or sip of drink, the brain
integrates the differential input from the taste buds and a complex ﬂavour
is perceived.

In the following sections, you will be introduced to the structure and
functioning of the eye (sensory organ for vision) and the ear (sensory organ
for hearing).

21.6.1 Eye

Our paired eyes are located in sockets of the skull called orbits. A brief
account of structure and functions of the human eye is given in the
following sections.

21.6.1.1 Parts of an eye

The adult human eye ball is
nearly a spherical structure. The
wall of the eye ball is composed
of three layers (Figure 2 1.6). The 2323;?
external layer is composed of a
dense connective tissue and is
called the sclera. The anterior
portion of this layer is called the
cornea. The middle layer,
choroid, contains many blood
vessels and looks bluish in
colour. The choroid layer is thin
over the posterior two-thirds of
the eye ball, but it becomes thick
in the anterior part to form the
ciliary body. The ciliary body
