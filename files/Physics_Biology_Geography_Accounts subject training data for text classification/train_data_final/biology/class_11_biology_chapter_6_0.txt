ANATOMY OF FLOWERING PLANTS

You can very easily see the structural similarities and variations in the
external morphology of the larger living organism, both plants and
animals. Similarly, if we were to study the internal structure, one also
finds several similarities as well as differences. This chapter introduces
you to the internal structure and functional organisation of higher plants.
Study of internal structure of plants is called anatomy. Plants have cells
as the basic unit, cells are organised into tissues and in turn the tissues
are organised into organs. Different organs in a plant show differences in
their internal structure. Within angiosperms, the monocots and dicots
are also seen to be anatomically different. Internal structures also show
adaptations to diverse environments.

6. 1 THE TISSUES

A tissue is a group of cells having a common origin and usually performing
a common function. A plant is made up of different kinds of tissues. Tissues
are classiÔ¨Åed into two main groups, namely, meristematic and permanent
tissues based on whether the cells being formed are capable of dividing
or not.

6. 1 . 1 Meristematic Tissues

Growth in plants is largely restricted to specialised regions of active cell division
called meristems (Gk. meristos: divided). Plants have different kinds of
meristems. The meristems which occur at the tips of roots and shoots and
produce primary tissues are called apical meristems (Figure 6.1).
