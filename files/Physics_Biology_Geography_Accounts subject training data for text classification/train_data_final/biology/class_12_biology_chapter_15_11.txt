ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES

 

Greenhouse gases
absorb long wave
(infrared) radiation from
the earth, and emit it
again towards the earth.
The cycle continues till

surprised to know that without greenhouse effect the average temperature
at surface of Earth would have been a chilly —18°C rather than the present
average of 15°C. In order to understand the

greenhouse effect, it is necessary to know the

fate of the energy of sunlight that reaches the CFCs 14% ‘
outermost atmosphere (Figure 16.6). Clouds
and gases reﬂect about one-fourth of the
incoming solar radiation, and absorb some of
it but almost half of incoming solar radiation
falls on Earth’s surface heating it, while a small
proportion is reﬂected back. Earth’s surface
re-emits heat in the form of infrared radiation
but part of this does not escape into space as
atmospheric gases (e. g. , carbon dioxide,
methane, etc.) absorb a major ﬁ'action of it. The

and a major part of which again comes to
Earth’s surface, thus heating it up once again.
This cycle is repeated many a times. The
above-mentioned gases — carbon dioxide and methane — are commonly
known as greenhouse gases (Figure 16.7) because they are responsible
for the greenhouse effect.

Increase in the level of greenhouse gases has led to considerable heating
of Earth leading to global warming. During the past century, the
temperature of Earth has increased by 0.6 °C, most of it during the last

warming
