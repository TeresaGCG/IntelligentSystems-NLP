14- 16 are covered by a prominent dark band of glandular tissue called
Clitellum. Thus the body is divisible into three prominent regions —
preclitellar, clitellar and postclitellar segments (Figure 7 .9).

Four pairs of spermathecal apertures are situated on the ventro-lateral
sides of the intersegmental grooves, Le, 5m -9“‘ segments. A single female
genital pore is present in the mid-ventral line of 14m segment. A pair of
male genital pores are present on the ventro-lateral sides of the 18m
segment. Numerous minute pores called nephridiopores open on the
surface of the body. In each body segment, except the ﬁrst, last and
Clitellum, there are rows of S—shaped setae, embedded in the epidermal
pits in the middle of each segment. Setae can be extended or retracted.
Their principal role is in locomotion.

7.3.2 Anatomy

The body wall of the earthworm is covered externally by a thin non-cellular
cuticle below which is the epidermis, two muscle layers (circular and
longitudinal) and an innermost coelomic epithelium. The epidermis is made
