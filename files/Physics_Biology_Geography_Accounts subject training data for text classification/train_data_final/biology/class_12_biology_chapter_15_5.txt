ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES

dissolved salts such as nitrates, phosphates, and other nutrients, and
toxic metal ions and organic compounds. Domestic sewage primarily
contains biodegradable organic matter, which readily decomposes —
thanks to bacteria and other micro-organisms, which can multiply using
these organic substances as substrates and hence utilise some of the
components of sewage. It is possible to estimate the amount of
biodegradable organic matter in sewage water by measuring Biochemical
Oxygen Demand (BOD). Can you explain how? In the chapter on micro-
organisms you have read about the relation between BOD, micro-
organisms and the amount of biodegradable matter.

Figure 16.3 shows some of the changes that one may notice following
discharge of sewage into a river. Micro-organisms involved in
biodegradation of organic matter in the receiving water body consume a
lot of oxygen, and as a result there is a sharp decline in dissolved oxygen
downstream from the point of sewage discharge. This causes mortality of
fish and other aquatic creatures.

Presence of large amounts of nutrients in waters also causes excessive
growth of planktonic (free-ﬂoating) algae, called an algal bloom
(Figure 16.4) which imparts a distinct colour to the water bodies. Algal
blooms cause deterioration of the water quality and ﬁsh mortality. Some
bloom-forming algae are extremely toxic to human beings and animals.

You may have seen the beautiful mauve-colored ﬂowers found on
very appealingly—shaped ﬂoating plants in water bodies. These plants
which were introduced into India for their lovely ﬂowers have caused havoc
by their excessive growth by causing blocks in our waterways. They grow
faster than our ability to remove them. These are plants of water hyacinth
(Eichhornia crassipes), the world’s most problematic aquatic weed, also
