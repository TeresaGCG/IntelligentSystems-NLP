BIOMOLECULES

The catalytic cycle of an enzyme action can be described in the following
steps:

1. First, the substrate binds to the active site of the enzyme, ﬁtting
into the active site.

2. The binding of the substrate induces the enzyme to alter its shape,
ﬁtting more tightly around the substrate.

3. The active site of the enzyme, now in close proximity of the
substrate breaks the chemical bonds of the substrate and the
new enzyme- product complex is formed.

4. The enzyme releases the products of the reaction and the free
enzyme is ready to bind to another molecule of the substrate and
run through the catalytic cycle once again.

9. 12.4 Factors Affecting Enzyme Activity

The activity of an enzyme can be affected by a change in the conditions
which can alter the tertiary structure of the protein. These include

temperature, pH, change in substrate concentration or binding of speciﬁc
chemicals that regulate its activity.

Temperature and pH

Enzymes generally function in a narrow range of temperature and pH
(Figure 9.7). Each enzyme shows its highest activity at a particular
temperature and pH called the optimum temperature and optimum pH.
Activity declines both below and above the optimum value. Low
temperature preserves the enzyme in a temporarily inactive state whereas

high temperature destroys enzymatic activity because proteins are
denatured by heat.
