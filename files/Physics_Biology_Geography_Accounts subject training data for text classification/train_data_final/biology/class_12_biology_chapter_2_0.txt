Are we not lucky that plants reproduce sexually? The
myriads of ﬂowers that we enjoy gazing at, the scents and
the perfumes that we swoon over, the rich colours that

Flowers do not exist only for us to be used for our own
selﬁshness. All ﬂowering plants show sexual reproduction.
A look at the diversity of structures of the inﬂorescences,
ﬂowers and ﬂoral parts, shows an amazing range of
adaptations to ensure formation of the end products of
sexual reproduction, the fruits and seeds. In this chapter,
let us understand the morphology, structure and the
processes of sexual reproduction in ﬂowering plants
(angiosperms) .
