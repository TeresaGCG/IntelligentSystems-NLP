Figure 13.8 The Calvin cycle proceeds in three stages : (l) carboxylation, during which
CO2 combines with ribulose-l ,5-bisphosphate; (2) reduction, during which
carbohydrate is formed at the expense of the photochemically made ATP
and NADPH; and (3) regeneration during which the CO2 acceptor ribulose-
1,5-bisphosphate is formed again so that the cycle continues

Reduction —These are a series of reactions that lead to the formation
of glucose. The steps involve utilisation of 2 molecules of ATP for
phosphorylation and two of NADPH for reduction per CO2 molecule
ﬁxed. The ﬁxation of six molecules of CO2 and 6 turns of the cycle are
required for the formation of one molecule of glucose from the pathway.

Regeneration — Regeneration of the CO2 acceptor molecule RuBP is
crucial if the cycle is to continue uninterrupted. The regeneration
steps require one ATP for phosphorylation to form RuBP.
