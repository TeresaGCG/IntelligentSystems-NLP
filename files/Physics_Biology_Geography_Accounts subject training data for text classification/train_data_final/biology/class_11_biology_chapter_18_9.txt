BODY FLUIDS AND CIRCULATION

hepatic portal system. The hepatic portal vein carries blood from intestine
to the liver before it is delivered to the systemic circulation. A special
coronary system of blood vessels is present in our body exclusively for
the circulation of blood to and from the cardiac musculature.

18.5 REGULATION OF CARDIAC ACTIVITY

Normal activities of the heart are regulated intrinsically, i.e., auto regulated
by specialised muscles (nodal tissue), hence the heart is called myogenic.
A special neural centre in the medulla oblangata can moderate the cardiac
function through autonomic nervous system (ANS). Neural signals through
the sympathetic nerves (part of AN S) can increase the rate of heart beat,
the strength of ventricular contraction and thereby the cardiac output.
On the other hand, parasympathetic neural signals (another component
of ANS) decrease the rate of heart beat, speed of conduction of action
potential and thereby the cardiac output. Adrenal medullary hormones
can also increase the cardiac output.

High Blood Pressure (Hypertension): Hypertension is the term for blood
pressure that is higher than normal (120/80). In this measurement 120
mm Hg (millimetres of mercury pressure) is the systolic, or pumping,
pressure and 80 mm Hg is the diastolic, or resting, pressure. If repeated
checks of blood pressure of an individual is 140/90 (140 over 90) or
