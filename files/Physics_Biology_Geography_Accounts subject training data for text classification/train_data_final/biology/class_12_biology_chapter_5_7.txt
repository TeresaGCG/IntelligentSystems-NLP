genotype t. As a result of random fertilisation, the resultant zygotes can
be of the genotypes TT, Tt or tt.

From the Punnett square it is easily seen that 1/4th of the random
fertilisations lead to TT, 1 / 2 lead to Tt and 1 /4th to tt. Though the F1
have a genotype of Tt, but the phenotypic character seen is ‘tall’. At F2,
3 / 4th of the plants are tall, where some of them are TT while others are
Tt. Externally it is not possible to distinguish between the plants with
the genotypes TT and Tt. Hence, within the genopytic pair Tt only one
character ‘T’ tall is expressed. Hence the character T or ‘tall’ is said to
dominate over the other allele t or ‘dwarf’ character. It is thus due to this
dominance of one character over the other that all the F1 are tall (though
the genotype is Tt) and in the F2 3/4th of the plants are tall (though
genotypically 1 / 2 are Tt and only 1 /4th are TT). This leads to a phenotypic
ratio of 3/4‘htall : (1/4TT + 1/2 Tt) and 1/4th tt, i.e., a 3:1 ratio, but a
genotypic ratio of 1 :2: 1.

The 1 / 4 : 1 / 2 : 1 / 4 ratio of TT: Tt: tt is mathematically condensable
to the form of the binomial expression (ax +by)2, that has the gametes
bearing genes T or t in equal frequency of 1/2. The expression is expanded
as given below :

(1/2T+ 1/2t)2 =(1/2T+ 1/2t)X(1/2T+ 1/2t) = 1/4TT+ 1/2Tt+ 1/4-tt

Mendel self-pollinated the F2 plants and found that dwarf F2 plants
continued to generate dwarf plants in F3 and F 4 generations. He concluded
that the genotype of the dwarfs was homozygous — tt. What do you think
he would have got had he self-pollinated a tall F2 plant?

From the preceeding paragraphs it is clear that though the genotypic
ratios can be calculated using mathematical probability, by simply looking
at the phenotype of a dominant trait, it is not possible to know the
genotypic composition. That is, for example, whether a tall plant from F1
or F2 has TT or Tt composition, cannot be predicted. Therefore, to determine
the genotype of a tall plant at F2, Mendel crossed the tall plant from F2
with a dwarf plant. This he called a test cross. In a typical test cross an
organism (pea plants here) showing a dominant phenotype (and whose
genotype is to be determined) is crossed with the recessive parent instead
of self-crossing. The progenies of such a cross can easily be analysed to
predict the genotype of the test organism. Figure 5.5 shows the results of
typical test cross where Violet colour ﬂower (W) is dominant over white
colour ﬂower (w).

Using Punnett square, try to ﬁnd out the nature of offspring of a test cross.
What ratio did you get?

Using the genotypes of this cross, can you give a general deﬁnition for
a test cross?
