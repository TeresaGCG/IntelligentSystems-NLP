20.2. 1 Structure of Contractile Proteins

 

BIOLOGY

Each actin (thin) ﬁlament is made of two ‘F’ (ﬁlamentous) actins
helically wound to each other. Each ‘F’ actin is a polymer of monomeric
‘G’ (Globular) actins. Two ﬁlaments of another protein, tropomyosin
also run close to the ‘F’ actins throughout its length. A complex protein
Troponin is distributed at regular intervals on the tropomyosin. In the
resting state a subunit of troponin masks the active binding sites for

myosin on the actin ﬁlaments (Figure 20.3a).

Each myosin (thick) ﬁlament is also a polymerised protein. Many
monomeric proteins called Meromyosins (Figure 20.3b) constitute one
thick ﬁlament. Each meromyosin has two important parts, a globular
head with a short arm and a tail, the former being called the heavy
meromyosin HMM) and the latter, the ﬁght meromyosin ﬂ.MM). The HMM
component, i.e.; the head and short arm projects outwards at regular
distance and angle from each other from the surface of a polymerised myosin
ﬁlament and is known as cross arm. The globular head is an active ATPase

enzyme and has binding sites for ATP and active sites for actin.

20.2.2 Mechanism of Muscle Contraction

Mechanism of muscle contraction is best explained by the sliding ﬁlament
theory which states that contraction of a muscle ﬁbre takes place by the
sliding of the thin ﬁlaments over the thick ﬁlaments.
