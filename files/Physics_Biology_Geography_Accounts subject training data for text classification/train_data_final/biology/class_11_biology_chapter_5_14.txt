MORPHOLOGY OF FLOWERING PLANTS

coat is the embryo, consisting of an
embryonal axis and two cotyledons. The
cotyledons are often ï¬‚eshy and full of reserve
food materials. At the two ends of the
embryonal axis are present the radicle and
the plumule (Figure 5.18). In some seeds
such as castor the endosperm formed as a
result of double fertilisation, is a food storing
tissue and called endospermic seeds. In
plants such as bean, gram and pea, the
endosperm is not present in mature seeds
and such seeds are called non-
endospermous.

5.7.2 Structure of Monocotyledonous Seed

Generally, monocotyledonous seeds are endospermic but some as in
orchids are non-endospermic. In the seeds of cereals such as maize the
seed coat is membranous and generally fused with the fruit wall. The
endosperm is bulky and stores food. The outer covering of endosperm
separates the embryo by a proteinous layer called aleurone layer. The
embryo is small and situated in a groove at one end of the endosperm. It
consists of one large and shield shaped cotyledon known as scutellum
and a short axis with a plumule and a radicle. The plumule and radicle
are enclosed in sheaths which are called coleoptile and coleorhiza

respectively (Figure 5.19).
