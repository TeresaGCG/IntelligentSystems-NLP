BIOTECHNOLOGY AND ITS APPLICATIONS

create pores that cause cell swelling and lysis and eventually cause death
of the insect.

Speciﬁc Bt toxin genes were isolated from Bacillus thuringiensis and
incorporated into the several crop plants such as cotton (Figure 12.1).
The choice of genes depends upon the crop and the targeted pest, as
most Bt toxins are insect-group speciﬁc. The toxin is coded by a gene
cryIAc named cry. There are a number of them, for example, the proteins
encoded by the genes cryIAc and cryIIAb control the cotton bollworrns,
that of cryIAb controls corn borer.

Pest Resistant Plants: Several nematodes parasitise a wide variety of
plants and animals including human beings. A nematode Meloidegyne
incognitia infects the roots of tobacco plants and causes a great reduction
in yield. A novel strategy was adopted to prevent this infestation which
was based on the process of RNA interference (RNAi). RNAi takes place
in all eukaryotic organisms as a method of cellular defense. This method
involves silencing of a speciﬁc mRNA due to a complementary dsRNA
molecule that binds to and prevents translation of the mRNA (silencing).
The source of this complementary RNA could be from an infection by
Viruses having RNA genomes or mobile genetic elements (transposons)
that replicate via an RNA intermediate.

Using Agrobacterium vectors, nematode-specific genes were
introduced into the host plant (Figure 12.2). The introduction of DNA
was such that it produced both sense and anti-sense RNA in the host
cells. These two RNA’s being complementary to each other formed a double
stranded (dsRNA) that initiated RNAi and thus, silenced the speciﬁc mRNA
