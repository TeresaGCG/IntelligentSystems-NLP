What are the key elements that lead to so much variation in the
physical and chemical conditions of different habitats? The most
important ones are temperature, water, light and soil. We must remember
that the physico-chemical (abiotic) components alone do not characterise
the habitat of an organism completely; the habitat includes biotic
components also — pathogens, parasites, predators and competitors — of
the organism with which they interact constantly. We assume that over a
period of time, the organism had through natural selection, evolved
adaptations to optimise its survival and reproduction in its habitat.

Each organism has an invariably deﬁned range of conditions that it
can tolerate, diversity in the resources it utilises and a distinct functional
role in the ecological system, all these together comprise its niche.

13. 1. 1 Major Abiotic Factors

Temperature: Temperature is the most important ecologically relevant
environmental factor. You are aware that the average temperature on
land varies seasonally, decreases progressively from the equator towards
the poles and from plains to the mountain tops. It ranges from subzero
levels in polar areas and high altitudes to >50°C in tropical deserts in
summer. There are, however, unique habitats such as thermal springs
and deep-sea hydrothermal vents where average temperatures exceed
1000 C. It is general knowledge that mango trees do not and cannot grow
