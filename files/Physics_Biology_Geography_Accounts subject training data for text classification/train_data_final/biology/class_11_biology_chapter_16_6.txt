DIGESTION AND ABSORPTION

 

the hepatic duct from the liver forms the common bile duct Wigure 1 6.6).
The bile duct and the pancreatic duct open together into the duodenum

as the common hepato-pancreatic duct which is guarded by a sphincter
called the sphincter of Oddi.

The pancreas is a compound (both exocrine and endocrine) elongated
organ situated between the limbs of the ‘C’ shaped duodenum. The
exocrine portion secretes an alkaline pancreatic juice containing enzymes
and the endocrine portion secretes hormones, insulin and glucagon.

16.2 DIGESTION OF FOOD

The process of digestion is accomplished by mechanical and chemical
processes.

The buccal cavity performs two major functions, mastication of food
and facilitation of swallowing. The teeth and the tongue with the help of
saliva masticate and mix up the food thoroughly. Mucus in saliva helps
in lubricating and adhering the masticated food particles into a bolus.
’Ihe bolus is then conveyed into the pharynx and then into the oesophagus
by swallowing or deglutition. The bolus further passes down through
the oesophagus by successive waves of muscular contractions called
peristalsis. The gastro-oesophageal sphincter controls the passage of food
into the stomach.The saliva secreted into the oral cavity contains
electrolytes (Na", K*, CI', H005) and enzymes, salivary amylase and
lysozyme. The chemical process of digestion is initiated in the oral cavity
by the hydrolytic action of the carbohydrate splitting enzyme, the salivary
