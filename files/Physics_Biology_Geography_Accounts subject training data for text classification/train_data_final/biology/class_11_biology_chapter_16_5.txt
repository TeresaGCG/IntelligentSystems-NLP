Figure 16.5 A section of small intestinal
mucosa showing villi

projections called microvilli giving a brush border
appearance. These modiﬁcations increase the
surface area enormously. Villi are supplied with
a network of capillaries and a large lymph vessel
called the lacteal. Mucosal epithelium has goblet
cells which secrete mucus that help in lubrication.
Mucosa also forms glands in the stomach (gastric
glands) and crypts in between the bases of villi in
the intestine (crypts of Lieberkuhn). All the four
layers show modiﬁcations in different parts of the
alimentary canal.

16. 1 .2 Digestive Glands

The digestive glands associated with the
alimentary canal include the salivary glands, the
liver and the pancreas.

Saliva is mainly produced by three pairs of
salivary glands, the parotids (cheek), the sub-
maxillary/sub-mandibular (lower jaw) and the
sub- linguals (below the tongue). These glands
situated just outside the buccal cavity secrete

salivary juice into the buccal cavity.

Liver is the largest gland of the body weighing about 1.2 to 1.5 kg in
an adult human. It is situated in the abdominal cavity, just below the
diaphragm and has two lobes. The hepatic lobules are the structural and
functional units of liver containing hepatic cells arranged in the form of
cords. Each lobule is covered by a thin connective tissue sheath called
the Glisson’s capsule. The bile secreted by the hepatic cells passes through
the hepatic ducts and is stored and concentrated in a thin muscular sac
called the gall bladder. The duct of gall bladder (cystic duct) along with
