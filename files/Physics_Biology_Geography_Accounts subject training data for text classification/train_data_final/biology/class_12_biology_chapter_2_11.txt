BIOLOGY

Majority of ﬂowering plants use
a range of animals as pollinating
agents. Bees, butterﬂies, ﬂies,
beetles, wasps, ants, moths, birds
(sunbirds and humming birds) and
bats are the common pollinating
agents. (Figure 2.1 lb). Among the
animals, insects, particularly bees
are the dominant biotic pollinating
agents. Even larger animals such
as some primates (lemurs), arboreal
(tree-dwelling) rodents, or even
reptiles (gecko lizard and garden
lizard) have also been reported as
pollinators in some species.

Often ﬂowers of animal-
pollinated plants are speciﬁcally
adapted for a particular species of
animal.

Majority of insect-pollinated
ﬂowers are large, colourful, fragrant
and rich in nectar. When the ﬂowers
are small, a number of ﬂowers are
clustered into an inﬂorescence to
make them conspicuous. Animals
are attracted to ﬂowers by colour
and / or fragrance. The ﬂowers
pollinated by ﬂies and beetles
secrete foul odours to attract these
animals. To sustain animal visits,
the ﬂowers have to provide rewards
to the animals. Nectar and pollen
grains are the usual ﬂoral rewards.
For harvesting the reward(s) from
the ﬂower the animal visitor comes
in contact with the anthers and the
stigma. The body of the animal gets
a coating of pollen grains, which are

generally sticky in animal pollinated ﬂowers. When the animal carrying
—

pollen on its body comes in contact with the stigma, it brings about

pollination.

In some species ﬂoral rewards are in providing safe places to lay eggs;
an example is that of the tallest ﬂower of Amorphophallus (the ﬂower
itself is about 6 feet in height). A similar relationship exists between a
species of moth and the plant Yucca where both species — moth and the
