ANATOMY OF FLOWERING PLANTS

Monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants show marked variation in their

internal structures. They differ in type, number and location of vascular bundles.
The secondary growth occurs in most of the dicotyledonous roots and stems and
it increases the girth (diameter) of the organs by the activity of the vascular cambium
and the cork cambium. The wood is actually a secondary xylem. There are different
types of wood on the basis of their composition and time of production.

EXERCISES

State the location and function of different types of meristems.

Cork cambium forms tissues that form the cork. Do you agree with this
statement? Explain.

Explain the process of secondary growth in the stems of woody angiosperms
with the help of schematic diagrams. What is its significance?

Draw illustrations to bring out the anatomical difference between
(a) Monocot root and Dicot root
(b) Monocot stem and Dicot stem

Cut a transverse section of young stem of a plant from your school garden and
observe it under the microscope. How would you ascertain whether it is a
monocot stem or a dicot stem? Give reasons.

The transverse section of a plant material shows the following anatomical
features - (a) the vascular bundles are conj oint, scattered and surrounded by a
sclerenchymatous bundle sheaths. (b) phloem parenchyma is absent. What
will you identify it as?

Why are xylem and phloem called complex tissues?

What is stomatal apparatus? Explain the structure of stomata with a labelled
diagram.

Name the three basic tissue systems in the ï¬‚owering plants. Give the tissue
names under each system.

How is the study of plant anatomy useful to us?

What is periderm? How does periderm formation take place in the dicot stems?

Describe the internal structure of a dorsiventral leaf with the help of labelled
diagrams.
