BIOLOGY

Those animals in which the developing embryo has a third germinal layer,
mesoderm, in between the ectoderm and endoderm, are called
triploblastic animals (platyhelminthes to chordates, Figure 4.2b).

4. 1.4 Coelom

Presence or absence of a cavity between the body
wall and the gut wall is very important in
classiﬁcation. The body cavity, which is lined
by mesoderm is called coelom. Animals
possessing coelom are called coelomates, e. g.,
annelids, molluscs, arthropods, echinoderms,
hemichordates and chordates (Figure 4.3a). In
some animals, the body cavity is not lined by
mesoderm, instead, the mesoderm is present as
scattered pouches in between the ectoderm and
endoderm. Such a body cavity is called
pseudocoelom and the animals possessing them
are called pseudocoelomates, e.g.,
aschehninthes (Figure 4.3b). The animals in

Figure 4.3 Diagrammatic sectional View of : WhiCh the body cavity is absent are called

(a) Coelomate (b) Pseudocoelomate acoelomates, e.g., platyhelminthes (Figure 4.3c).
(c) Acoelomate

4. 1 .5 Segmentation

In some animals, the body is externally and internally divided into
segments with a serial repetition of at least some organs. For example, in
earthworm, the body shows this pattern called metameric segmentation
and the phenomenon is known as metamerism.

4. 1 .6 Notochord

Notochord is a mesodermally derived rod-like structure formed on the
dorsal side during embryonic development in some animals. Animals with
notochord are called chordates and those animals which do not form this
structure are called non-chordates, e. g., porifera to echinoderms.

4.2 CLASSIFICATION OF ANIMALS

The broad classiﬁcation of Animalia based on common fundamental
features as mentioned in the preceding sections is given in Figure 4.4.
