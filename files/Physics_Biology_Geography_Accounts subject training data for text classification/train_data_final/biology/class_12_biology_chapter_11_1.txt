HERBERT BOYER
(1936 )

Herbert Boyer was born in 1936 and brought up in a corner of western
Pennsylvania where railroads and mines were the destiny of most young
men. He completed graduate work at the University of Pittsburgh, in
1963, followed by three years of post—graduate studies at Yale.

In 1966, Boyer took over assistant professorship at the University of
California at San Francisco. By 1969, he performed studies on a couple
of restriction enzymes of the E. coli bacterium with especially useful
properties. Boyer observed that these enzymes have the capability of
cutting DNA strands in a particular fashion, which left what has became
known as ‘sticky ends’ on the strands. These clipped ends made pasting
together pieces of DNA a precise exercise.

This discovery, in turn, led to a rich and rewarding conversation in
Hawaii with a Stanford scientist named Stanley Cohen. Cohen had
been studying small ringlets of DNA called plasmids and which float
about freely in the cytoplasm of certain bacterial cells and replicate
independently from the coding strand of DNA. Cohen had developed
a method of removing these plasmids from the cell and then reinserting
them in other cells. Combining this process with that of DNA splicing
enabled Boyer and Cohen to recombine segments of DNA in desired
configurations and insert the DNA in bacterial cells, which could then
act as manufacturing plants for specific proteins. This breakthrough was
the basis upon which the discipline of biotechnology was founded.
