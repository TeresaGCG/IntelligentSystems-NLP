CHAPTER 1
REPRODUCTION IN ORGANISMS

1.1 Asexual

Reproduction
12 Sexual Each and every organism can live only for a certain period
Reproduction of time. The period from birth to the natural death of an

organism represents its life span. Life spans of a few
organisms are given in Figure 1.1. Several other organisms
are drawn for which you should ﬁnd out their life spans
and write in the spaces provided. Examine the life spans
of organisms represented in the Figure 1.1. Isn’t it both
interesting and intriguing to note that it may be as short
as a few days or as long as a few thousand years? Between
these two extremes are the life spans of most other living
organisms. You may note that life spans of organisms are
not necessarily correlated with their sizes; the sizes of
crows and parrots are not very different yet their life spans
show a wide difference. Similarly, a mango tree has a much
shorter life span as compared to a peepal tree. Whatever
be the life span, death of every individual organism is a
certainty, i.e., no individual is immortal, except single-celled
organisms. Why do we say there is no natural death in
single— celled organisms? Given this reality, have you ever
wondered how vast number of plant and animal species
have existed on earth for several thousands of years? There
must be some processes in living organisms that ensure
this continuity. Yes, we are talking about reproduction,
something that we take for granted.
