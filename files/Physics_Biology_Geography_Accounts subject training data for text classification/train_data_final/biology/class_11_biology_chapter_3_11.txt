3.5 ANGIOSPERMS

Unlike the gymnosperms where the ovules are naked, in the angiosperms
or ﬂowering plants, the pollen grains and ovules are developed in
specialised structures called ﬂowers. In angiosperms, the seeds are
enclosed in fruits. The angiosperms are an exceptionally large group of
plants occurring in wide range of habitats. They range in size from the
smallest Wolﬂ‘ia to tall trees of Eucalyptus (over 100 metres). They provide
us with food, fodder, fuel, medicines and several other commercially
important products. They are divided into two classes : the dicotyledons
and the monocotyledons (Figure 3.5). The dicotyledons are
characterised by seeds having two cotyledons, reticulate venations in
leaves, and tetramerous or pentamerous ﬂowers, i.e., having four or five
members in each ﬂoral whorls. The monocotyledons on the other hand
are characterised by single cotyledonous seeds, parallel venation in
leaves, and trimerous ﬂowers having three members in each ﬂoral whorls.
The male sex organ in a ﬂower is the stamen. Each stamen consists of a
slender ﬁlament with an anther at the tip. Within the anthers, the pollen
mother cell divide by meiosis to produce microspores which matures
into pollen grains. The female sex organ in a ﬂower is the pistil. Pistil
consists of a swollen ovary at its base, a long slender style and stigma.
Inside the ovary, ovules are present. Generally each ovule has a
megaspore mother cell that undergoes meiosis to form four haploid
megaspores. Three of them degenerate and one divide to form the embryo
sac. Each embryo-sac has a three-celled egg apparatus — one egg cell
and two synergids, three antipodal cells and two polar nuclei. The polar
