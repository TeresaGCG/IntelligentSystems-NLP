PHOTOSYNTHESIS IN HIGHER PLANTS

Now study the pathway shown in Figure 1 3.9. This pathway that has
been named the Hatch and Slack Pathway, is again a cyclic process. Let
us study the pathway by listing the steps.

The primary CO2 acceptor is a 3-carbon molecule phosphoenol
pyruvate (PEP) and is present in the mesophyll cells. The enzyme
responsible for this ﬁxation is PEP carboxylase or PEPcase. It is important
to register that the mesophyll cells lack RuBisCO enzyme. The C 4 acid
OAA is formed in the mesophyll cells.

It then forms other 4—carbon compounds like malic acid or aspartic
acid in the mesophyll cells itself, which are transported to the bundle
sheath cells. In the bundle sheath cells these C 4 acids are broken down
to release CO2 and a 3-carbon molecule.

The 3-carbon molecule is transported back to the mesophyll where it
is converted to PEP again, thus, completing the cycle.

The CO2 released in the bundle sheath cells enters the C3 or the Calvin
pathway, a pathway common to all plants. The bundle sheath cells are
