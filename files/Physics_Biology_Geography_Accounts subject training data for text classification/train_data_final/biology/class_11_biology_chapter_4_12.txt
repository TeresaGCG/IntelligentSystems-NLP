4.2.11.5 Class - Reptilia

The class name refers to their creeping or crawling mode of locomotion
(Latin, repere or reptum, to creep or crawl). They are mostly terrestrial
animals and their body is covered by dry and corniﬁed skin, epidermal
scales or scutes (Fig. 4.22). They do not have external ear openings.
Tympanum represents ear. Limbs, when present, are two pairs. Heart is
usually three-chambered, but four-chambered in crocodiles. Reptiles are
poikilotherms. Snakes and lizards shed their scales as skin cast. Sexes
are separate. Fertilisation is internal. They are oviparous and development
is direct.

Examples: Chelone (Turtle), Testudo (Tortoise), Chameleon (I‘ree lizard),
Calotes (Garden lizard), Crocodilus (Crocodile), Alligator (Alligator).

Hemidactylus (Wall lizard), Poisonous snakes — Naja (Cobra), Bangarus
(Krait), Vipera (Viper).

4.2.11.6 Class - Aves

The characteristic features of Aves (birds) are the presence of feathers
and most of them can ﬂy except ﬂightless birds (e. g., Ostrich). They possess
beak (Figure 4.23). The forelimbs are modiﬁed into wings. The hind limbs
generally have scales and are modiﬁed for walking, swimming or clasping
the tree branches. Skin is dry without glands except the oil gland at the
base of the tail. Endoskeleton is fully ossiﬁed (bony) and the long bones
are hollow with air cavities (pneumatic). The digestive tract of birds has
additional chambers, the crop and gizzard. Heart is completely four-
chambered. They are warm-blooded (homoiothermous) animals, i.e.,
they are able to maintain a constant body temperature. Respiration is by
