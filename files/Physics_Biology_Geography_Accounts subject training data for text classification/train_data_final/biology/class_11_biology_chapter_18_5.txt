BODY FLUIDS AND CIRCULATION

18.3. 1 Human Circulatory System

Human circulatory system, also called the blood vascular system consists
of a muscular chambered heart, a network of closed branching blood
vessels and blood, the ﬂuid which is circulated.

Heart, the mesodermally derived organ, is situated in the thoracic
cavity, in between the two lungs, slightly tilted to the left. It has the size of
a clenched fist. It is protected by a double walled membranous bag,
pericardium, enclosing the pericardial ﬂuid. Our heart has four
chambers, two relatively small upper chambers called atria and two larger
lower chambers called ventricles. A thin, muscular wall called the inter-
atrial septum separates the right and the left atria, whereas a thick-walled,
the inter-ventricular septum, separates the left and the right ventricles
(Figure 18.2). The atrium and the ventricle of the same side are also
separated by a thick fibrous tissue called the atrio-ventricular septum.
However, each of these septa are provided with an opening through which
the two chambers of the same side are connected. The opening between
the right atrium and the right ventricle is guarded by a valve formed of
three muscular ﬂaps or cusps, the tricuspid valve, whereas a bicuspid
or mitral valve guards the opening between the left atrium and the left
ventricle. The openings of the right and the left ventricles into the
