Table 5.3: A Comparison between the Behaviour of Chromosomes
and Genes

[ff]

â€˜ Occur in pairs Occur in pairs I

 

Segregate at the time of gamete Segregate at gamete formation and only
fomiation such that only one of each one of each pair is transmitted to a
pair is transmitted to a gamete gamete

Independent pairs segregate One pair segregates independently of
independently of each other another pair

Can you tell which of these columns A or B represent the chromosome
and which represents the gene? How did you decide?

During Anaphase of meiosis I, the two chromosome pairs can align at
the metaphase plate independently of each other (Figure 5.9). To
understand this, compare the chromosomes of four different colour in
the left and right columns. In the left column (Possibility I) orange and
green is segregating together. But in the right hand column (Possibility
II) the orange chromosome is segregating with the red chromosomes.

 

 

Possibility I Possibility 11
One long orange and short green One long orange and short red
chromosome and long yellow and chromosome and long yellow and
short red chromosome at the short green chromosome at the
same pole same pole
Meiosis I - anaphase Meiosis I - anaphase
Meiosis II - anaphase Meiosis II - anaphase
