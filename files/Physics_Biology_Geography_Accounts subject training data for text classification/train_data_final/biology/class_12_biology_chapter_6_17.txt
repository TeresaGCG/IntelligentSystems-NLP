instrumental in synthesising RNA molecules with deﬁned combinations
of bases (homopolymers and copolymers). Marshall Nirenberg’s cell-free
system for protein synthesis ﬁnally helped the code to be deciphered.
Severo Ochoa enzyme (polynucleotide phosphorylase) was also helpful
in polymerising RNA with deﬁned sequences in a template independent
manner (enzymatic synthesis of RNA). Finally a checker-board for genetic
code was prepared which is given in Table 6.1.

The salient features of genetic code are as follows:

(i) The codon is triplet. 6 1 codons code for amino acids and 3 codons do
not code for any amino acids, hence they function as stop codons.

(ii) Some amino acids are coded by more than one codon, hence
the code is degenerate.

(iii) The codon is read in mRNA in a contiguous fashion. There are
no punctuations.

(iv) The code is nearly universal: for example, from bacteria to human
UUU would code for Phenylalanine (phe). Some exceptions to this
rule have been found in mitochondrial codons, and in some
protozoans.

(v) AUG has dual functions. It codes for Methionine (met) , and it
also act as initiator codon.

(Vi) UAA, UAG, UGA are stop terminator codons.

If following is the sequence of nucleotides in mRNA, predict the
sequence of amino acid coded by it (take help of the checkerboard):
