BODY FLUIDS AND CIRCULATION

the body surface by using electrocardiograph and the recording is called
electrocardiogram (ECG) which is of clinical importance.

We have a complete double circulation, i.e., two circulatory pathways, namely,
pulmonary and systemic are present. The pulmonary circulation starts by the
pumping of deoxygenated blood by the right ventricle which is carried to the lungs
where it is oxygenated and returned to the left atrium. The systemic circulation
starts with the pumping of oxygenated blood by the left ventricle to the aorta
which is carried to all the body tissues and the deoxygenated blood from there is
collected by the veins and returned to the right atrium. Though the heart is

autoexcitable, its functions can be moderated by neural and hormonal mechanisms.
