9.8 NATURE OF BOND LINKING MONOMERS IN A POLYMER

In a polypeptide or a protein, amino acids are linked by a peptide
bond which is formed when the carboxyl (-COOH) group of one amino
acid reacts with the amino (-NHZ) group of the next amino acid with
the elimination of a water moiety (the process is called dehydration).
In a polysaccharide the individual monosaccharides are linked by a
glycosidic bond. This bond is also formed by dehydration. This bond
is formed between two carbon atoms of two adjacent monosaccharides.
In a nucleic acid a phosphate moiety links the 3’-carbon of one sugar
of one nucleotide to the 5’-carbon of the sugar of the succeeding
nucleotide. The bond between the phosphate and hydroxyl group of
sugar is an ester bond. As there is one such ester bond on either side,
it is called phosphodiester bond (Figure 9.5).

Nucleic acids exhibit a wide variety of secondary structures. For
example, one of the secondary structures exhibited by DNA is the
famous Watson-Crick model. This model says that DNA exists as a
double helix. The two strands of polynucleotides are antiparallel i.e.,
run in the opposite direction. The backbone is formed by the sugar-
phosphate-sugar chain. The nitrogen bases are projected more or less
perpendicular to this backbone but face inside. A and G of one strand
compulsorily base pairs with T and C, respectively, on the other strand.
