14.7 RESPIRATORY QUOTIENT

Let us now look at another aspect of respiration. As you know, during
aerobic respiration, O2 is consumed and CO2 is released. The ratio of the
volume of CO2 evolved to the volume of O2 consumed in respiration is
called the respiratory quotient (R9) or respiratory ratio.

 

 

The respiratory quotient depends upon the type of respiratory
substrate used during respiration.

When carbohydrates are used as substrate and are completely
oxidised, the RQ will be 1, because equal amounts of CO2 and 02 are
evolved and consumed, respectively, as shown in the equation below :
