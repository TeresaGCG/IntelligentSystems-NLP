system of electron carriers called electron transport system (ETS) located on the
inner membrane of the mitochondria. The electrons, as they move through the
system, release enough energy that are trapped to synthesise ATP. This is called
oxidative phosphorylation. In this process 02 is the ultimate acceptor of electrons
and it gets reduced to water.

The respiratory pathway is an amphibolic pathway as it involves both anabolism
and catabolism. The respiratory quotient depends upon the type of respiratory
substance used during respiration.
