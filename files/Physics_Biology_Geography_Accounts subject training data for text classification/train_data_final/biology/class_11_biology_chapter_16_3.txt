attached to the ﬂoor of the oral cavity by the frenulum. The upper surface
of the tongue has small projections called papillae, some of which bear
taste buds.

The oral cavity leads into a short pharynx which serves as a common
passage for food and air. The oesophagus and the trachea (wind pipe)
open into the pharynx. A cartilaginous ﬂap called epiglottis prevents the
entry of food into the glottis — opening of the wind pipe — during swallowing.
The oesophagus is a thin, long tube which extends posteriorly passing
through the neck, thorax and diaphragm and leads to a ‘J’ shaped bag
