22.2.7 Adrenal Gland

Our body has one pair of adrenal glands, one at the anterior part of each
kidney (Figure 22.4 a). The gland is composed of two types of tissues.
The centrally located tissue is called the adrenal medulla, and outside

this lies the adrenal cortex (Figure 22.4 b).
Underproduction of hormones by the adrenal cortex alters
carbohydrate metabolism causing acute weakness and fatigue leading

to a disease called Addisonâ€™s disease.

The adrenal medulla secretes two hormones called adrenaline or
epinephrine and noradrenaline or norepinephrine. These are
commonly called as catecholamines. Adrenaline and noradrenaline are
rapidly secreted in response to stress of any kind and during emergency
situations and are called emergency hormones or hormones of Fight
or Flight. These hormones increase alertness, pupilary dilation,
piloerection (raising of hairs), sweating etc. Both the hormones increase
the heart beat, the strength of heart contraction and the rate of respiration.
Catecholamines also stimulate the breakdown of glycogen resulting in
