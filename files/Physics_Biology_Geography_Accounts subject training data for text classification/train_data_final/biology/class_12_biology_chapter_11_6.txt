BIOTECHNOLOGY : PRINCIPLES AND PROCESSES

reading is kept the same. For example, the following sequences reads
the same on the two strands in 5' 9 3' direction. This is also true if
read in the 3' 9 5' direction.

5’ — GAA’ITC — 3’

3’ — C’I'I‘AAG — 5’

Restriction enzymes cut the strand of DNA a little away from the centre
of the palindrome sites, but between the same two bases on the opposite
strands. This leaves single stranded portions at the ends. There are
overhanging stretches called sticky ends on each strand (Figure 1 1.1).
These are named so because they form hydrogen bonds with their
complementary cut counterparts. This stickiness of the ends facilitates
the action of the enzyme DNA ligase.

Restriction endonucleases are used in genetic engineering to form
‘recombinant’ molecules of DNA, which are composed of DNA from
different sources / genomes.

When cut by the same restriction enzyme, the resultant DNA fragments
have the same kind of ‘sticky-ends’ and, these can be joined together
(end-to-end) using DNA ligases (Figure 1 1.2).
