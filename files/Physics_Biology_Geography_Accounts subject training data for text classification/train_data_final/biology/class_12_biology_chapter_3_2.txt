The penis is the male external genitalia (Figure 3.1a, b). It is made up
of special tissue that helps in erection of the penis to facilitate insemination.
The enlarged end of penis called the glans penis is covered by a loose fold
of skin called foreskin.

The male accessory glands (Figure 3.1a, b) include paired seminal
vesicles, a prostate and paired bulbourethral glands. Secretions of these
glands constitute the seminal plasma which is rich in fructose, calcium
and certain enzymes. The secretions of bulbourethral glands also helps
in the lubrication of the penis.

3.2 THE FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM

The female reproductive system consists of a pair of ovaries alongwith a pair
of oviducts, uterus, cervix, vagina and the external genitalia located in
pelvic region (Figure 3.3a). These parts of the system alongwith a pair of the
mammary glands are integrated structurally and functionally to support
the processes of ovulation, fertilisation, pregnancy, birth and child care.

Ovaries are the primary female sex organs that produce the female
gamete (ovum) and several steroid hormones (ovarian hormones).
The ovaries are located one on each side of the lower abdomen
(Figure 3.3b). Each ovary is about 2 to 4 cm in length and is connected to
the pelvic wall and uterus by ligaments. Each ovary is covered by a thin
epithelium which encloses the ovarian stroma. The stroma is divided into
two zones â€” a peripheral cortex and an inner medulla.
