STRUCTURAL ORGANISATION IN ANIMALS

7.4.2 Anatomy

The alimentary canal present in the body cavity
is divided into three regions: foregut, midgut
and hindgut (Figure 7.16). The mouth opens
into a short tubular pharynx, leading to a
narrow tubular passage called oesophagus.
This in turn opens into a sac like structure
called crop used for storing of food. The crop
is followed by gizzard or proventriculus. It has
an outer layer of thick circular muscles and
thick inner cuticle forming six highly chitinous
plate called teeth. Gizzard helps in grinding the
food particles. The entire foregut is lined by
cuticle. A ring of 6-8 blind tubules called
hepatic or gastric caeca is present at the
junction of foregut and midgut, which secrete
digestive juice. At the junction of midgut and
hindgut is present another ring of 100-150
yellow coloured thin Ô¨Ålamentous Malpighian
tubules. They help in removal of excretory
products from haemolymph. The hindgut is
broader than midgut and is differentiated into
ileum, colon and rectum. The rectum opens
out through anus.

Blood vascular system of cockroach is an
open type (Figure 7.17). Blood vessels are
poorly developed and open into space
(haemocoel). Visceral organs located in the
haemocoel are bathed in blood (haemolymph).
The haemolymph is composed of colourless
plasma and haemocytes. Heart of cockroach
consists of elongated muscular tube lying
along mid dorsal line of thorax and abdomen.
It is differentiated into funnel shaped chambers
with ostia on either side. Blood from sinuses
enter heart through ostia and is pumped
anteriorly to sinuses again.

The respiratory system consists of a
network of trachea, that open through 10 pairs
of small holes called spiracles present on the
lateral side of the body. Thin branching tubes
(tracheal tubes subdivided into tracheoles)
