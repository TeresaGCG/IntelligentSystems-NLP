potential difference across the resting plasma membrane is called as the
resting potential.

You might be curious to know about the mechanisms of generation
of nerve impulse and its conduction along an axon. When a stimulus is
applied at a site (Figure 21.2 e. g., point A) on the polarised membrane,
the membrane at the site A becomes freely permeable to Na’“. This leads
to a rapid inﬂux of Na+ followed by the reversal of the polarity at that site,
i.e., the outer surface of the membrane becomes negatively charged and
the inner side becomes positively charged. The polarity of the membrane
at the site A is thus reversed and hence depolarised. The electrical potential
difference across the plasma membrane at the site A is called the
action potential, which is in fact termed as a nerve impulse. At sites
immediately ahead, the axon (e. g., site B) membrane has a positive charge
on the outer surface and a negative charge on its inner surface. As a
result, a current ﬂows on the inner surface from site A to site B. On the
outer surface current ﬂows from site B to site A (Figure 2 1.2) to complete
the circuit of current ﬂow. Hence, the polarity at the site is reversed, and
an action potential is generated at site B. Thus, the impulse (action
potential) generated at site A arrives at site B. The sequence is repeated
along the length of the axon and consequently the impulse is conducted.
The rise in the stimulus-induced permeability to Na+ is extremely short-
lived. It is quickly followed by a rise in permeability to K’“. Within a fraction
of a second, K’“ diffuses outside the membrane and restores the resting
potential of the membrane at the site of excitation and the ﬁbre becomes
once more responsive to further stimulation.
