syndrome and the corresponding chromosomes of the individual

individual may lack one of any one pair of
chromosomes. These situations are known as trisomy
or monosomy of a chromosome, respectively. Such a
situation leads to very serious consequences in the
individual. Down’s syndrome, Turner’s syndrome,
Klinefelter’s syndrome are common examples of
chromosomal disorders.

Down’s Syndrome : The cause of this genetic disorder
is the presence of an additional copy of the
chromosome number 2 1 (trisomy of 2 1). This disorder
was first described by Langdon Down (1866). The
affected individual is short statured with small round
head, furrowed tongue and partially open mouth

[ﬂinefelter’s Syndrome : This genetic disorder is also
caused due to the presence of an additional copy of X-
chromosome resulting into a karyotype of 47, XXY.

Syndrome (Figure 5.1 7 a). Such individuals are sterile.
Turner’s Syndrome : Such a disorder is caused due
m to the absence of one of the X chromosomes, i.e., 45 with X0, Such females
are sterile as ovaries are rudimentary besides other features including
—

lack of other secondary sexual characters (Figure 5.17 b).
