SUMMARY

There are special chemicals which act as hormones and provide chemical
coordination, integration and regulation in the human body. These hormones
regulate metabolism, growth and development of our organs, the endocrine glands
or certain cells. The endocrine system is composed of hypothalamus, pituitary
and pineal, thyroid, adrenal, pancreas, parathyroid, thymus and gonads (testis
and ovary). In addition to these, some other organs, e.g., gastrointestinal tract,
kidney, heart etc., also produce hormones. The pituitary gland is divided into
three major parts, which are called as pars distalis, pars intermedia and pars
nervosa. Pars distalis produces six trophic hormones. Pars intermedia secretes
