also in a counter current pattern. The proximity between the Henle’s loop
and vasa recta, as well as the counter current in them help in maintaining
an increasing osmolarity towards the inner medullary interstitium, 1.6.,
from 300 mOsmolL‘1 in the cortex to about 1200 mOsmolL‘1 in the inner
medulla. This gradient is mainly caused by NaCl and urea. NaCl is
transported by the ascending limb of Henle’s loop which is exchanged
with the descending limb of vasa recta. NaCl is returned to the interstitium
by the ascending portion of vasa recta. Similarly, small amounts of urea
enter the thin segment of the ascending limb of Henle’s loop which is
transported back to the interstitium by the collecting tubule. The above
described transport of substances facilitated by the special arrangement
of Henle’s loop and vasa recta is called the counter current mechanism
Wigure. 19.6). This mechanism helps to maintain a concentration gradient
