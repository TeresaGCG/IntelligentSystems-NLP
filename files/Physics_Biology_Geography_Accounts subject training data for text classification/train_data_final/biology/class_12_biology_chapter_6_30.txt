If a double stranded DNA has 20 per cent of cytosine, calculate the per
cent of adenine in the DNA.

If the sequence of one strand of DNA is written as follows:
5 ' -ATGCATG CATGCATG CATG CATGCATGC -3 '

Write down the sequence of complementary strand in 5'—>3' direction.

Which property of DNA double helix led Watson and Crick to hypothesise
semi-conservative mode of DNA replication? Explain.

Depending upon the chemical nature of the template (DNA or RNA)
and the nature of nucleic acids synthesised from it (DNA or RNA), list
the types of nucleic acid polymerases.

How did Hershey and Chase differentiate between DNA and protein in
their experiment while proving that DNA is the genetic material?

Differentiate between the followings:

(b) mRNA and tRNA

(c) Template strand and Coding strand

List two essential roles of ribosome during translation.
