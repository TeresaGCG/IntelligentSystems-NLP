Biotechnology and Its
Applications

 

Ever since the days of Rene Descartes, the French philosopher,
mathematician and biologist of seventeenth century, all human
knowledge especially natural sciences were directed to develop
technologies which add to the creature comforts of human
lives, as also value to human life. The whole approach to
understanding natural phenomena became anthropocentric.
Physics and chemistry gave rise to engineering, technologies
and industries which all worked for human comfort and welfare.
The major utility of the biological world is as a source of food.
Biotechnology, the twentieth century off-shoot of modern
biology, changed our daily life as its products brought
qualitative improvement in health and food production. The
basic principles underlying biotechnological processes and some
applications are highlighted and discussed in this unit.
