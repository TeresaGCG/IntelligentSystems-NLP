BIOLOGY

The bulk movement of substances through the conducting or vascular
tissues of plants is called translocation.

Do you remember studying cross sections of roots, stems and leaves
of higher plants and studying the vascular system? The higher plants
have highly specialised vascular tissues — xylem and phloem. Xylem is
associated with translocation of mainly water, mineral salts, some organic
nitrogen and hormones, from roots to the aerial parts of the plants. The
phloem translocates a variety of organic and inorganic solutes, mainly
from the leaves to other parts of the plants.

1 1.3. 1 How do Plants Absorb Water?

We know that the roots absorb most of the water that goes into plants;
obviously that is why we apply water to the soil and not on the leaves.
The responsibility of absorption of water and minerals is more speciﬁcally
the function of the root hairs that are present in millions at the tips of the
roots. Root hairs are thin-walled slender extensions of root epidermal
cells that greatly increase the surface area for absorption. Water is
absorbed along with mineral solutes, by the root hairs, purely by diffusion.
Once water is absorbed by the root hairs, it can move deeper into root
layers by two distinct pathways:

' apoplast pathway
' symplast pathway

The apoplast is the system of adjacent cell walls that is continuous
throughout the plant, except at the casparian strips of the endodermis
in the roots (Figure 1 1.6). The apoplastic movement of water occurs
exclusively through the intercellular spaces and the walls of the cells.
Movement through the apoplast does not involve crossing the cell
