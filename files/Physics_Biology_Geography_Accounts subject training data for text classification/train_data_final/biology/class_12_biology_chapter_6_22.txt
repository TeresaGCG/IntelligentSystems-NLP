Figure 6.14 The lac Operon

Lactose is the substrate for the enzyme beta-galactosidase and it
regulates switching on and off of the operon. Hence, it is termed as inducer.
In the absence of a preferred carbon source such as glucose, if lactose is
provided in the growth medium of the bacteria, the lactose is transported
into the cells through the action of permease (Remember, a very low level
of expression of lac operon has to be present in the cell all the time,
otherwise lactose cannot enter the cells). The lactose then induces the
operon in the following manner.
The repressor of the operon is synthesised (all-the-time — constitutively)
from the igene. The repressor protein binds to the operator region of the
operon and prevents RNA polymerase from transcribing the operon. In
the presence of an inducer, such as lactose or allolactose, the repressor is
inactivated by interaction with the inducer. This allows RNA polymerase
access to the promoter and transcription proceeds (Figure 6.14).
Essentially, regulation of lac operon can also be visualised as regulation
of enzyme synthesis by its substrate. 1 1 7
Remember, glucose or galactose cannot act as inducers for lac
operon. Can you think for how long the lac operon would be expressed
in the presence of lactose?
Regulation of lac operon by repressor is referred to as negative
regulation. Lac operon is under control of positive regulation as well,
but it is beyond the scope of discussion at this level.
