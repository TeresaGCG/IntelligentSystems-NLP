Figure 15.7 Diagrammatic comparison of absolute and relative growth rates. Both

leaves A and B have increased their area by 5 cm2 in a given time to
produce A1, B1 leaves.

Quantitative comparisons between the growth of living system can
also be made in two ways : (i) measurement and the comparison of total
growth per unit time is called the absolute growth rate. (ii) The growth of
the given system per unit time expressed on a common basis, e.g., per
unit initial parameter is called the relative growth rate. In Figure 15.7
two leaves, A and B, are drawn that are of different sizes but shows
absolute increase in area in the given time to give leaves, A1 and B1. However,
one of them shows much higher relative growth rate. Which one and why?

15. 1.5 Conditions for Growth

Why do you not try to write down what you think are necessary conditions
for growth? This list may have water, oxygen and nutrients as very essential
elements for growth. The plant cells grow in size by cell enlargement which
in turn requires water. Turgidity of cells helps in extension growth. Thus,
plant growth and further development is intimately linked to the water
status of the plant. Water also provides the medium for enzymatic activities
needed for growth. Oxygen helps in releasing metabolic energy essential
for growth activities. Nutrients (macro and micro essential elements) are
required by plants for the synthesis of protoplasm and act as source of
energy.

In addition, every plant organism has an optimum temperature range
best suited for its growth. Any deviation from this range could be
detrimental to its survival. Environmental signals such as light and gravity
also affect certain phases/ stages of growth.
