ANIMAL KINGDOM

Echinoderms and Chordates, organs have
associated to form functional systems, each
system concerned with a speciÔ¨Åc physiological
function. This pattern is called organ system
level of organisation. Organ systems in different
groups of animals exhibit various patterns of
complexities. For example, the digestive system
in Platyhelminthes has only a single opening
to the outside of the body that serves as both
mouth and anus, and is hence called
incomplete. A complete digestive system has
two openings, mouth and anus. Similarly, the
circulatory system may be of two types:

(i) open type in which the blood is pumped
out of the heart and the cells and tissues are
directly bathed in it and

(ii) closed type in which the blood is circulated
through a series of vessels of valying diameters
(arteries, veins and capillaries).

4. 1 .2 Symmetry

Animals can be categorised on the basis of their
symmetry. Sponges are mostly asymmetrical,
i.e., any plane that passes through the centre
does not divide them into equal halves. When
any plane passing through the central axis of
the body divides the organism into two identical
halves, it is called radial symmetry.
Coelenterates, ctenophores and echinoderms
have this kind of body plan (Figure 4. 1a).
Animals like annelids, arthropods, etc., where
the body can be divided into identical left and
right halves in only one plane, exhibit bilateral
symmetry (Figure 4.1b).

4.1.3 Diploblastic and Triploblastic
Organisation

Animals in which the cells are arranged in two
embryonic layers, an external ectoderm and
an internal endoderm, are called diploblastic
animals, e.g., coelenterates. An undilferentiated
layer, mesoglea, is present in between the
ectoderm and the endoderm (Figure 4.2a).
