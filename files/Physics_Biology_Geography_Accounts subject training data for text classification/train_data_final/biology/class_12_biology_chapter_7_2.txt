Polysaccharides, etc.). These capsules reproduced their molecules perhaps.
The ﬁrst cellular form of life did not possibly originate till about 2000
million years ago. These were probably single-cells. All life forms were in
water environment only. This version of a biogenesis, i.e., the ﬁrst form of
life arose slowly through evolutionary forces from non-living molecules is
accepted by majority. However, once formed, how the ﬁrst cellular forms
of life could have evolved into the complex biodiversity of today is the
fascinating story that will be discussed below.

7.2 EVOLUTION OF LIFE FORMS - A THEORY

Conventional religious literature tells us about the theory of special
creation. This theory has three connotations. One, that all living organisms
(species or types) that we see today were created as such. Two, that the
diversity was always the same since creation and will be the same in future
also. Three, that earth is about 4000 years Old. All these ideas were
strongly challenged during the nineteenth century. Based on Observations
made during a sea voyage in a sail ship called H.M.S. Beagle round the
world, Charles Darwin concluded that existing living forms share
similarities to varying degrees not only among themselves but also with
life forms that existed millions of years ago. Many such life forms do not
exist any more. There had been extinctions Of different life forms in the
years gone by j ust as new forms of life arose at different periods of history
of earth. There has been gradual evolution of life forms. Any population
