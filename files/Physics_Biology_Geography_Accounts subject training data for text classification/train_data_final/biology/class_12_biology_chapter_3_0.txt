HUMAN REPRODUCTION

3. 1 The Male Reproductive

System
32 The Female Reproductive As you are aware, humans are sexually reproducing and
System viviparous. The reproductive events in humans include

formation of gametes (gametogenesis), i.e., sperms in males
and ovum in females, transfer of sperms into the female
34 Menstrual Cycle genital tract (insemination) and fusion of male and female
gametes (fertilisation) leading to formation of zygote. This
is followed by formation and development of blastocyst

3.3 Gametogenesis

3.5 Fertilisation and

Imp lantation and its attachment to the uterine wall (implantation),
3.6 Pregnancy and embryonic development (gestation) and delivery of the
Embryonic Development baby (parturition). You have learnt that these reproductive

events occur after puberty. There are remarkable
differences between the reproductive events in the male
and in the female, for example, sperm formation continues
even in old men, but formation of ovum ceases in women
around the age of fifty years. Let us examine the male and
female reproductive systems in human.

3. 7 Parturition and Lactation

3. 1 THE MALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM

The male reproductive system is located in the pelvis region
(Figure 3.1a). It includes a pair of testes alongwith
accessory ducts, glands and the external genitalia.
