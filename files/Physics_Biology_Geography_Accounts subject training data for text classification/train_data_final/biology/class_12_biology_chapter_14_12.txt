80, if N is the population density at time t, then its density at time t + 1 is
Nt+1 = Nt + [(B + I) — (D + E)]

You can see from the above equation (Fig. 13.5) that population
density will increase if the number of births plus the number of
immigrants (B + I) is more than the number of deaths plus the number
of emigrants (D + E). Under normal conditions, births and deaths are
the most important factors inﬂuencing population density, the other
two factors assuming importance only under special conditions. For
instance, if a new habitat is just being colonised, immigration may
contribute more significantly to population growth than birth rates.
Growth Models : Does the growth of a population with time show any
specific and predictable pattern? We have been concerned about
unbridled human population growth and problems created by it in our
countIy and it is therefore natural for us to be curious if different animal
populations in nature behave the same way or show some restraints on
growth. Perhaps we can learn a lesson or two from nature on how to
control population growth.

(1) Exponential growth: Resource (food and space) availability is
obviously essential for the unimpeded growth of a population.
Ideally, when resources in the habitat are unlimited, each species
has the ability to realise fully its innate potential to grow in number,
as Darwin observed while developing his theory of natural
selection. Then the population grows in an exponential or
