Figure 6.1 Apical meristem: (a) Root (b) Shoot

Root apical meristem occupies the tip of a root while the shoot apical
meristem occupies the distant most region of the stem axis. During the
formation of leaves and elongation of stem, some cells ‘left behind’ from
shoot apical meristem, constitute the axillary bud. Such buds are present
in the axils of leaves and are capable of forming a branch or a ﬂower. The
meristem which occurs between mature tissues is known as intercalary
meristem. They occur in grasses and regenerate parts removed by the
grazing herbivores. Both apical meristems and intercalary meristems are
primary meristems because they appear early in life of a plant and
contribute to the formation of the primary plant body.

The meristem that occurs in the mature regions of roots and shoots of
many plants, particularly those that produce woody axis and appear
later than primary meristem is called the secondary or lateral meristem.
They are cylindrical meristems. Fascicular vascular cambium,
interfascicular cambium and cork-cambium are examples of lateral
meristems. These are responsible for producing the secondary tissues.

Following divisions of cells in both primary and as well as secondary

meristems, the newly formed cells become structurally and functionally
specialised and lose the ability to divide. Such cells are termed permanent
or mature cells and constitute the permanent tissues. During the
formation of the primary plant body, speciﬁc regions of the apical meristem
produce dermal tissues, ground tissues and vascular tissues.
