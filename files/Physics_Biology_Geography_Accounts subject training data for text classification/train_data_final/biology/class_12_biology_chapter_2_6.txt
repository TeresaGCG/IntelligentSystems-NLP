Class XI. Arising from the placenta are the megasporangia, commonly
called ovules. The number of ovules in an ovary may be one (wheat,
paddy, mango) to many (papaya, water melon, orchids).

The Megasporangium (Ovule) : Let us familiarise ourselves with the
structure of a typical angiosperrn ovule (Figure 2.7d). The ovule is a small
structure attached to the placenta by means of a stalk called funicle.
The body of the ovule fuses with funicle in the region called hilum. Thus,
hilum represents the junction between ovule and funicle. Each ovule has
one or two protective envelopes called integuments. Integuments encircle
the nucellus except at the tip where a small opening called the micropyle
is organised. Opposite the micropylar end, is the chalaza, representing
the basal part of the ovule.

Enclosed within the integuments is a mass of cells called the nucellus.
Cells of the nucellus have abundant reserve food materials. Located in the
nucellus is the embryo sac or female gametophyte. An ovule generally has —
a single embryo sac formed from a megaspore.

Megasporogenesis : The process of formation of megaspores from the
megaspore mother cell is called megasporogenesis. Ovules generally
differentiate a single megaspore mother cell (MMC) in the micropylar region
