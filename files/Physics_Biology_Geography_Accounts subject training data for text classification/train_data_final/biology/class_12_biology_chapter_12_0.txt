BIOTECHNOLOGY AND ITS
APPLICATIONS

1 2.1 Biotechnological
Applications in

Agriculture Biotechnology, as you would have learnt from the

previous chapter, essentially deals with industrial scale
production of biopharmaceuticals and biologicals using
genetically modiﬁed microbes, fungi, plants and animals.
The applications of biotechnology include therapeutics,
123 Transgenic Animals diagnostics, genetically modiﬁed crops for agriculture,
processed food, bioremediation, waste treatment, and
energy production. Three critical research areas of
biotechnology are:
(i) Providing the best catalyst in the form of improved
organism usually a microbe or pure enzyme.
(ii) Creating optimal conditions through engineering for
a catalyst to act, and
(iii) Downstream processing technologies to purify the
protein / organic compound.
Let us now learn how human beings have used
biotechnology to improve the quality of human life,
especially in the ﬁeld of food production and health.

12.1 BIOTECHNOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS IN
AGRICULTURE

Let us take a look at the three options that can be thought
for increasing food production
(i) agro-chemical based agriculture;
