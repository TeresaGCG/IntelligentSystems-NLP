CELL: THE UNIT OF LIFE

When you look around, you see both living and non-living things. You
must have wondered and asked yourself — ‘What is it that makes an
organism living, or What is it that an inanimate thing does not have Which
a living thing has’ ? The answer to this is the presence of the basic unit of
life — the cell in all living organisms.

All organisms are composed of cells. Some are composed of a single

cell and are called unicellular organisms While others, like us, composed
of many cells, are called multicellular organisms.

8.1 WHAT IS A CELL?

Unicellular organisms are capable of (i) independent existence and
(ii) performing the essential functions of life. Anything less than a complete
structure of a cell does not ensure independent living. Hence, cell is the
fundamental structural and functional unit of all living organisms.

Anton Von Leeuwenhoek ﬁrst saw and described a live cell. Robert
Brown later discovered the nucleus. The invention of the microscope and
its improvement leading to the electron microscope revealed all the
structural details of the cell.

8.2 CELL THEORY

In 1838, Matthias Schleiden, a German botanist, examined a large number
of plants and observed that all plants are composed of different kinds of
cells Which form the tissues of the plant. At about the same time, Theodore
