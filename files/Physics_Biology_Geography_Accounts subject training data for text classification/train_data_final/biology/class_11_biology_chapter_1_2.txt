THE LIVING WORLD

How wonderful is the living world ! The wide range of living types is
amazing. The extraordinary habitats in which we find living organisms,
be it cold mountains, deciduous forests, oceans, fresh water lakes, deserts
or hot springs, leave us speechless. The beauty of a galloping horse, of
the migrating birds, the valley of ﬂowers or the attacking shark evokes
awe and a deep sense of wonder. The ecological conﬂict and cooperation
among members of a population and among populations of a community
or even the molecular traffic inside a cell make us deeply reﬂect on — what
indeed is life? This question has two implicit questions within it. The ﬁrst
is a technical one and seeks answer to what living is as opposed to the
non-living, and the second is a philosophical one, and seeks answer to
what the purpose of life is. As scientists, we shall not attempt answering
the second question. We will try to reﬂect on — what is living?

1. 1 WHAT IS ‘LIVING’?

When we try to define ‘living’, we conventionally look for distinctive
characteristics exhibited by living organisms. Growth, reproduction, ability
to sense environment and mount a suitable response come to our mind
immediately as unique features of living organisms. One can add a few
more features like metabolism, ability to self-replicate, self-organise,
interact and emergence to this list. Let us try to understand each of these.

All living organisms grow. Increase in mass and increase in number
of individuals are twin characteristics of growth. A multicellular organism
