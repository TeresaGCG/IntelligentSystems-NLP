and breakage is repeated causing further sliding. The process continues
till the Ca++ ions are pumped back to the sarcoplasmic cisternae resulting
in the masking of actin ﬁlaments. This causes the return of ‘Z’ lines back
to their original position, i.e., relaxation. The reaction time of the fibres
can vary in different muscles. Repeated activation of the muscles can lead
to the accumulation of lactic acid due to anaerobic breakdown of glycogen
in them, causing fatigue. Muscle contains a red coloured oxygen storing
pigment called myoglobin. Myoglobin content is high in some of the
muscles which gives a reddish appearance. Such muscles are called the
Red fibres. These muscles also contain plenty of mitochondria which can
utilise the large amount of oxygen stored in them for ATP production.
These muscles, therefore, can also be called aerobic muscles. On the
other hand, some of the muscles possess very less quantity of myoglobin
and therefore, appear pale or whitish. These are the White ﬁbres. Number
of mitochondria are also few in them, but the amount of sarcoplasmic
reticulum is high. They depend on anaerobic process for energy.
