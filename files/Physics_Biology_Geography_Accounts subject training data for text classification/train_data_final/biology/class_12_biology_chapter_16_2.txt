BIOLOGY

Let us look at some interesting aspects about earth’s biodiversity based
on the currently available species inventories. More than 70 per cent of
all the species recorded are animals, while plants (including algae, fungi,
bryophytes, gymnosperms and angiosperms) comprise no more than 22
per cent of the total. Among animals, insects are the most species-rich
taxonomic group, making up more than 70 per cent of the total. That
means, out of every 10 animals on this planet, 7 are insects. Again, how
do we explain this enormous diversiﬁcation of insects? The number of
fungi species in the world is more than the combined total of the species
of ﬁshes, amphibians, reptiles and mammals. In Figure 1 5. 1, biodiversity
is depicted showing species number of major taxa.

It should be noted that these estimates do not give any ﬁgures for
prokaryotes. Biologists are not sure about how many prokaryotic species
there might be. The problem is that conventional taxonomic methods are
not suitable for identifying microbial species and many species are simply
not culturable under laboratory conditions. If we accept biochemical or
molecular criteria for delineating species for this group, then their diversity
alone might run into millions.
