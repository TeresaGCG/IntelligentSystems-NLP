Homo erectus probably ate meat. The Neanderthal man with a brain size
of 140000 lived in near east and central Asia between 1 ,00,000-40,000
years back. They used hides to protect their body and buried their dead.
Homo sapiens arose in Africa and moved across continents and developed
into distinct races. During ice age between 7 5,000- 10,000 years ago
modern Homo sapiens arose. Pre-historic cave art developed about
18,000 years ago. One such cave paintings by Pre-historic humans can
be seen at Bhimbetka rock shelter in Raisen district of Madhya Pradesh.
Agriculture came around 10,000 years back and human settlements
started. The rest of what happened is part of human history of growth
and decline of civilisations.
