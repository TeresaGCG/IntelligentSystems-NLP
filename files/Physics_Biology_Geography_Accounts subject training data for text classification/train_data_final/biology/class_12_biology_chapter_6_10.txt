MOLECULAR BASIS OF INHERITANCE

and human cells. Matthew Meselson and Franklin Stahl performed the
following experiment in 1958:

(i) They grew E. coli in a medium containing 15NH4CI (“N is the heavy
isotope of nitrogen) as the only nitrogen source for many
generations. The result was that 15N was incorporated into newly
synthesised DNA (as well as other nitrogen containing compounds).
This heavy DNA molecule could be distinguished from the normal
DNA by centrifugation in a cesium chloride (CsCl) density gradient
(Please note that 15N is not a radioactive isotope, and it can be
separated from 14N only based on densities).

(ii) Then they transferred the cells into a medium with normal
14NH4Cl and took samples at various deﬁnite time intervals as
the cells multiplied, and extracted the DNA that remained as
double-stranded helices. The various samples were separated

independently on CsCl gradients to measure the densities of
DNA (Figure 6.7).

Can you recall what centrifugal force is, and think why a
molecule with higher mass/ density would sediment faster?

The results are shown in Figure 6.7.

(iii) Thus, the DNA that was extracted from the culture one
generation after the transfer from 15N to 14N medium [that is
after 20 minutes; E. coli divides in 20 minutes] had a hybrid or

intermediate density. DNA extracted from the culture after
another generation [that is after 40 minutes, II generation] was
