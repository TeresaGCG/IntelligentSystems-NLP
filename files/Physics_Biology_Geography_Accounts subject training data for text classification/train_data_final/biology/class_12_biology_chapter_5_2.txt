PRINCIPLES OF INHERITANCE
AND VARIATION

5.2 Inheritance ofOn e Gene Have you ever wondered why an elephant always gives
birth only to a baby elephant and not some other animal?

Given that they do, are the offspring identical to their

parents? Or do they show differences in some of their
5.6 Genetic Disorders characteristics? Have you ever wondered why siblings
sometimes look so similar to each other? Or sometimes
even so different?

These and several related questions are dealt with,
scientiﬁcally, in a branch of biology known as Genetics.
This subject deals with the inheritance, as well as the
variation of characters from parents to offspring.
Inheritance is the process by which characters are passed
on from parent to progeny; it is the basis of heredity.
Variation is the degree by which progeny differ from their
parents.

Humans knew from as early as 8000- 1000 B.C. that
one of the causes of variation was hidden in sexual
reproduction. They exploited the variations that were
naturally present in the wild populations of plants and
animals to selectively breed and select for organisms that
possessed desirable characters. For example, through
artificial selection and domestication from ancestral
