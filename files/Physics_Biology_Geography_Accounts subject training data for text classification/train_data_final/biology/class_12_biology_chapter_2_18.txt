Figure 2.15 (a) Structure of some seeds. (b) False fruits of apple and strawberry

in which fruits develop without fertilisation. Such fruits are called

parthenocarpic fruits. Banana is one such example. Parthenocarpy can

be induced through the application of growth hormones and such fruits

are seedless. â€”
Seeds offer several advantages to angiosperms. Firstly, since

reproductive processes such as pollination and fertilisation are

independent of water, seed formation is more dependable. Also seeds have
better adaptive strategies for dispersal to new habitats and help the species
