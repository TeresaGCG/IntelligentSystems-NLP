STRUCTURAL ORGANISATION IN ANIMALS

Earthworms are known as ‘friends of farmers’ because they make
burrows in the soil and make it porous which helps in respiration and
penetration of the developing plant roots. The process of increasing fertility
of soil by the earthworms is called vermicomposting. They are also used
as bait in game ﬁshing.

7.4 COCKROACH

Cockroaches are brown or black bodied animals that are included in
class Insecta of Phylum Arthropoda. Bright yellow, red and green coloured
cockroaches have also been reported in tropical regions. Their size ranges
from 14 inches to 3 inches (0.6-7 .6 cm) and have long antenna, legs and
ﬂat extension of the upper body wall that conceals head. They are
nocturnal omnivores that live in damp places throughout the world. They
have become residents of human homes and thus are serious pests and
vectors of several diseases.

7.4. 1 Morphology

The adults of the common species of cockroach, Periplaneta americana
are about 34-53 mm long with wings that extend beyond the tip of the
abdomen in males. The body of the cockroach is segmented and divisible
into three distinct regions — head, thorax and abdomen (Figure 7 . 14).
The entire body is covered by a hard chitinous exoskeleton (brown in
colour). In each segment, exoskeleton has hardened plates called sclerites
(tergites dorsally and sternites ventrally) that are joined to each other by
a thin and ﬂexible articular membrane (arthrodial membrane).
