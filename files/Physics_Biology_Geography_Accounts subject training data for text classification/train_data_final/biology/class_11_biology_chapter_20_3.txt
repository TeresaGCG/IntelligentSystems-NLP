myosin. Both the proteins are arranged as rod-like structures, parallel to
each other and also to the longitudinal axis of the myoﬁbrils. Actin
ﬁlaments are thinner as compared to the myosin ﬁlaments, hence are
commonly called thin and thick ﬁlaments respectively. In the centre of
each ‘1’ band is an elastic fibre called ‘Z’ line which bisects it. The thin
filaments are firmly attached to the ‘Z’ line. The thick ﬁlaments in the
‘A’ band are also held together in the middle of this band by a thin ﬁbrous
membrane called ‘M’ line. The ‘A’ and ‘1’ bands are arranged alternately
throughout the length of the myoﬁbrils. The portion of the myoﬁbril
between two successive ‘Z’ lines is considered as the functional unit of
contraction and is called a sarcomere (Figure 20.2). In a resting state, the
edges of thin ﬁlaments on either side of the thick ﬁlaments partially overlap
the free ends of the thick ﬁlaments leaving the central part of the thick
ﬁlaments. This central part of thick ﬁlament, not overlapped by thin
filaments is called the ‘H’ zone.
