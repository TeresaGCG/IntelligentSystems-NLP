1 .4.4 Zoological Parks

These are the places where wild animals are kept in protected environments
under human care and which enable us to learn about their food habits
and behaviour. All animals in a zoo are provided, as far as possible, the
conditions similar to their natural habitats. Children love visiting these
parks, commonly called Zoos (Figure 1.3).

1.4.5 Key

Key is another taxonomical aid used for identiÔ¨Åcation of plants and animals
based on the similarities and dissimilarities. The keys are based on the
contrasting characters generally in a pair called couplet. It represents
the choice made between two opposite options. This results in acceptance
of only one and rejection of the other. Each statement in the key is called
a lead. Separate taxonomic keys are required for each taxonomic category
such as family, genus and species for identification purposes. Keys are
generally analytical in nature.
