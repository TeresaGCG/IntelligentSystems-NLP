MORPHOLOGY OF FLOWERING PLANTS

The wide range in the structure of higher plants will never fail to fascinate
us. Even though the angiosperms show such a large diversity in external
structure or morphology, they are all characterised by presence of roots,
stems, leaves, ﬂowers and fruits.

In chapters 2 and 3, we talked about classification of plants based
on morphological and other characteristics. For any successful attempt
at classification and at understanding any higher plant (or for that
matter any living organism) we need to know standard technical terms
and standard definitions. We also need to know about the possible
variations in different parts, found as adaptations of the plants to their
environment, e. g. , adaptions to various habitats, for protection,
climbing, storage, etc.

If you pull out any weed you will see that all of them have roots, stems
and leaves. They may be bearing ﬂowers and fruits. The underground
part of the ﬂowering plant is the root system while the portion above the
ground forms the shoot system (Figure 5.1).

5.1 THE ROOT

In majority of the dicotyledonous plants, the direct elongation of the radicle
leads to the formation of primary root which grows inside the soil.
It bears lateral roots of several orders that are referred to as secondary,
tertiary, etc. roots. The primary roots and its branches constitute the
