BIOLOGY

isobilateral leaf, the stomata are present
on both the surfaces of the epidermis; and
the mesophyll is not differentiated into
palisade and spongy parenchyma (Figure
6.8 b).

In grasses, certain adaxial epidermal
cells along the veins modify themselves
into large, empty, colourless cells. These
are called bulliform cells. When the
bulliform cells in the leaves have absorbed
water and are turgid, the leaf surface is
exposed. When they are ﬂaccid due to
water stress, they make the leaves curl
inwards to minimise water loss.

The parallel venation in monocot
leaves is reﬂected in the near similar sizes
of vascular bundles (except in main veins)
as seen in vertical sections of the leaves.

6.4 SECONDARY GROWTH

The growth of the roots and stems in
length with the help of apical meristem is
called the primary growth. Apart from
primary growth most dicotyledonous
plants exhibit an increase in girth. This
increase is called the secondary growth.
The tissues involved in secondary growth
are the two lateral meristems: vascular
cambium and cork cambium.

6.4. 1 Vascular Cambium

The meristematic layer that is responsible
for cutting off vascular tissues — xylem and
pholem — is called vascular cambium. In
the young stem it is present in patches as
a single layer between the xylem and
phloem. Later it forms a complete ring.

6.4.1.1 Formation of cambial ring

In dicot stems, the cells of cambium present
between primary xylem and primary
phloem is the intrafascicular cambium.
