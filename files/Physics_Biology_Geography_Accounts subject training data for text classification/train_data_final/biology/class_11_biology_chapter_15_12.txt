PLANT GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT

Similarly, there are a number of events in the life of a plant where
more than one PGR interact to affect that event, e. g., dormancy in seeds /
buds, abscission, senescence, apical dominance, etc.

Remember, the role of PGR is of only one kind of intrinsic control.
Along with genomic control and extrinsic factors, they play an important
role in plant growth and development. Many of the extrinsic factors such
as temperature and light, control plant growth and development via PGR.
Some of such events could be: vernalisation, ﬂowering, dormancy, seed
germination, plant movements, etc.

We shall discuss brieﬂy the role of light and temperature (both of them,
the extrinsic factors) on initiation of ﬂowering.

15.5 PHOTOPERIODISM

It has been observed that some plants require a periodic exposure to
light to induce ﬂowering. It is also seen that such plants are able to
measure the duration of exposure to light. For example, some plants
require the exposure to light for a period exceeding a well deﬁned critical
duration, while others must be exposed to light for a period less than this
critical duration before the ﬂowering is initiated in them. The former group
of plants are called long day plants while the latter ones are termed
short day plants. The critical duration is different for different plants.
There are many plants, however, where there is no such correlation
between exposure to light duration and induction of ﬂowering response;
such plants are called day-neutral plants (Figure 15.12). It is now also
