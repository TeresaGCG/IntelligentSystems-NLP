membrane-bound structure with the outer membrane and the inner
membrane dividing its lumen distinctly into two aqueous compartments,
i.e., the outer compartment and the inner compartment. The inner
compartment is filled with a dense homogeneous substance called the
matrix. The outer membrane forms the continuous limiting boundary of
the organelle. The inner membrane forms a number of infoldings called
the cristae (sing.: crista) towards the matrix (Figure 8.7). The cristae
increase the surface area. The two membranes have their own specific
enzymes associated with the mitochondrial function. Mitochondria are
the sites of aerobic respiration. They produce cellular energy in the form
of ATP, hence they are called ‘power houses’ of the cell. The matrix also
possesses single circular DNA molecule, a few RNA molecules, ribosomes
(7 OS) and the components required for the synthesis of proteins. The
mitochondria divide by fission.

8. 5.5 Plastids

Plastids are found in all plant cells and in euglenoides. These are easily
observed under the microscope as they are large. They bear some speciﬁc
pigments, thus imparting specific colours to the plants. Based on the
type of pigments plastids can be classified into chloroplasts,
chromoplasts and leucoplasts.

The chloroplasts contain chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments which
are responsible for trapping light energy essential for photosynthesis. In
the chromoplasts fat soluble carotenoid pigments like carotene,
xanthophylls and others are present. This gives the part of the plant a
yellow, orange or red colour. The leucoplasts are the colourless plastids
of varied shapes and sizes with stored nutrients: Amyloplasts store
carbohydrates (starch), e. g., potato; elaioplasts store oils and fats whereas
