4.2.11.1 Class — Cyclostomata

All living members of the class Cyclostomata are
ectoparasites on some fishes. They have an
elongated body bearing 6- 15 pairs of gill slits
for respiration. Cyclostomes have a sucking and
circular mouth without jaws (Fig. 4.18). Their
body is devoid of scales and paired fins.
Cranium and vertebral column are
cartilaginous. Circulation is of closed type.
Cyclostomes are marine but migrate for
spawning to fresh water. After spawning, within
a few days, they die. Their larvae, after
metamorphosis, return to the ocean.

4.2.11.2 Class - Chondrichthyes

They are marine animals with streamlined body
and have cartilaginous endoskeleton
(Figure 4.19). Mouth is located ventrally.
Notochord is persistent throughout life. Gill
slits are separate and without operculum (gill
cover). The skin is tough, containing minute
placoid scales. Teeth are modified placoid
scales which are backwardly directed. Their
jaws are very powerful. These animals are
