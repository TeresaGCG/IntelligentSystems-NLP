NEURAL CONTROL AND COORDINATION

2 1.3.2 Transmission of Impulses

A nerve impulse is transmitted from one neuron to another through
junctions called synapses. A synapse is formed by the membranes of a
pre-synaptic neuron and a post-synaptic neuron, which may or may not
be separated by a gap called synaptic cleft. There are two types of
synapses, namely, electrical synapses and chemical synapses. At electrical
synapses, the membranes of pre- and post-synaptic neurons are in very
close proximity. Electrical current can ﬂow directly from one neuron into
the other across these synapses. Transmission of an impulse across
electrical synapses is very similar to impulse conduction along a single
axon. Impulse transmission across an electrical synapse is always faster
than that across a chemical synapse. Electrical synapses are rare in our
system.

At a chemical synapse, the membranes of the pre- and post-synaptic
neurons are separated by a ﬂuid-ﬁlled space called synaptic cleft
(Figure 21.3). Do you know how the pre-synaptic neuron transmits an
impulse (action potential) across the synaptic cleft to the post-synaptic
neuron? Chemicals called neurotransmitters are involved in the
transmission of impulses at these synapses. The axon terminals contain
vesicles filled with these neurotransmitters. When an impulse (action
potential) arrives at the axon terminal, it stimulates the movement of the
synaptic vesicles towards the membrane where they fuse with the plasma
