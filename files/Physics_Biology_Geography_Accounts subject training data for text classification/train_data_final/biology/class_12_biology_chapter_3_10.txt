membrane. This induces the completion of the meiotic division of the
secondary oocyte. The second meiotic division is also unequal and results
in the formation of a second polar body and a haploid ovum (ootid). Soon
the haploid nucleus of the sperms and that of the ovum fuse together to
form a diploid zygote. How many chromosomes will be there in the zygote?

One has to remember that the sex of the baby has been decided at this
stage itself. Let us see howâ€˜? As you know the chromosome pattern in the
human female is XX and that in the male is XY. Therefore, all the haploid
gametes (ova) produced by the female have the sex chromosome thereas
in the male gametes (sperms) the sex chromosome could be either X or Y,
hence, 50 per cent of sperms carry the X chromosome while the other 50 per
cent carry the Y. After fusion of the male and female gametes the zygote
would carry either XX or XY depending on whether the sperm carrying X
or Y fertilised the ovum. The zygote carryingXXwould develop into a female
baby and XY would form a male (you will learn more about the chromosomal
patterns in Chapter 5). That is why, scientifically it is correct to say that the
sex of the baby is determined by the father and not by the mother!

The mitotic division starts as the zygote moves through the isthmus
of the oviduct called cleavage towards the uterus (Figure 3.1 1) and forms
2, 4, 8, 16 daughter cells called blastomeres. The embryo with 8 to 16
