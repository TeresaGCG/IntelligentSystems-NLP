EXERCISES

Deﬁne growth, differentiation, development, dedifferentiation, redifferentiation,
determinate growth, meristem and growth rate.

Why is not any one parameter good enough to demonstrate growth throughout
the life of a ﬂowering plant?

Describe brieﬂy:

(a) Arithmetic growth

(b) Geometric growth

(c) Sigmoid growth curve

(d) Absolute and relative growth rates

List ﬁve main groups of natural plant growth regulators. Write a note on

discovery, physiological functions and agricultural / horticultural applications
of any one of them.

What do you understand by photoperiodism and vernalisation? Describe their
signiﬁcance.

Why is abscisic acid also known as stress hormone?
‘Both growth and differentiation in higher plants are open’. Comment.

‘Both a short day plant and a long day plant can produce can ﬂower
simultaneously in a given place’. Explain.

Which one of the plant growth regulators would you use if you are asked to:
(a) induce rooting in a twig

(b) quickly ripen a fruit

(c) delay leaf senescence

(d) induce growth in axillary buds

(e) ‘bolt’ a rosette plant

(f) induce immediate stomatal closure in leaves.

Would a defoliated plant respond to photoperiodic cycle? Why?

What would be expected to happen if:

(a) GA3 is applied to rice seedlings

(b) dividing cells stop differentiating

(c) a rotten fruit gets mixed with unripe fruits

(d) you forget to add cytokinin to the culture medium.
