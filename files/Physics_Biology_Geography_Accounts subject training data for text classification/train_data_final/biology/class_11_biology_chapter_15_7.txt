Figure 15.8 Sequence of the developmental process in a plant cell

Plants follow different pathways in response to environment or phases
of life to form different kinds of structures. This ability is called plasticity,
e. g., heterophylly in cotton, coriander and larkspur. In such plants, the
leaves of the juvenile plant are different in shape from those in mature
plants. On the other hand, difference in shapes of leaves produced in air
and those produced in water in buttercup also represent the
heterophyllous development due to environment (Figure 15.9). This
phenomenon of heterophylly is an example of plasticity.
