PHOTOSYNTHESIS IN HIGHER PLANTS

 

4. RuBisCO is an enzyme that acts both as a carboxylase and oxygenase. Why do
you think RuBisCO carries out more carboxylation in C 4 plants?

5. Suppose there were plants that had a high concentration of Chlorophyll b, but
lacked chlorophyll a, would it carry out photosynthesis? Then why do plants
have chlorophyll b and other accessory pigments?

6. Why is the colour of a leaf kept in the dark frequently yellow, or pale green?
Which pigment do you think is more stable?

7. Look at leaves of the same plant on the shady side and compare it with the
leaves on the sunny side. Or, compare the potted plants kept in the sunlight with
those in the shade. Which of them has leaves that are darker green ? Why?

8. Figure 13. 10 shows the effect of light on the rate of photosynthesis. Based on the
graph, answer the following questions:
(a) At which point/ s (A, B or C) in the curve is light a limiting factor?
(b) What could be the limiting factor / s in region A?
(c) What do C and D represent on the curve?

9. Give comparison between the following:

(a) C3 and C 4 pathways
(b) Cyclic and non-cyclic photophosphorylation
(c) Anatomy of leaf in C3 and C 4 plants
