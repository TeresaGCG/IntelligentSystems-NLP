BIOLOGY

As the name suggests, Cardiac muscles are the muscles of heart.
Many cardiac muscle cells assemble in a branching pattern to form a
cardiac muscle. Based on appearance, cardiac muscles are striated. They
are involuntary in nature as the nervous system does not control their
activities directly.

Let us examine a skeletal muscle in detail to understand the structure
and mechanism of contraction. Each organised skeletal muscle in our
body is made of a number of muscle bundles or fascicles held together
by a common collagenous connective tissue layer called fascia. Each
muscle bundle contains a number of muscle ﬁbres (Figure 20.1). Each

muscle fibre is lined by the plasma membrane called sarcolemma
enclosing the sarcoplasm. Muscle ﬁbre is a syncitium as the sarcoplasm
contains many nuclei. The endoplasmic reticulum, i.e., sarcoplasmic
reticulum of the muscle ﬁbres is the store house of calcium ions. A
characteristic feature of the muscle ﬁbre is the presence of a large number
of parallelly arranged ﬁlaments in the sarcoplasm called myoﬁlaments or
myoﬁbrils. Each myoﬁbril has alternate dark and light bands on it. A
detailed study of the myoﬁbril has established that the striated appearance
is due to the distribution pattern of two important proteins — Actin and
Myosin. The light bands contain actin and is called I-band or Isotropic
band, whereas the dark band called ‘A’ or Anisotropic band contains
