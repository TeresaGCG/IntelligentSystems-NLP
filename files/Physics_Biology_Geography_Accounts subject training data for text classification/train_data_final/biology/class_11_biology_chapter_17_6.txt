Partial pressure of oxygen (mm Hg)

BIOLOGY

17.4 TRANSPORT 0F GASES

Blood is the medium of transport for O2 and C02. About 97 per cent of O2 is
transported by RBCs in the blood. The remaining 3 per cent of O2 is carried
in a dissolved state through the plasma. Nearly 20-25 per cent of CO2 is
transported by RBCs whereas 7 0 per cent of it is carried as bicarbonate.
About 7 per cent of CO2 is carried in a dissolved state through plasma.

1? .4. 1 Transport of Oxygen

Haemoglobin is a red coloured iron containing pigment present in the
RBCs. 02 can bind with haemoglobin in a reversible manner to form
oxyhaemoglobin. Each haemoglobin molecule can carry a maximum of
four molecules of 02. Binding of oxygen with haemoglobin is primarily
related to partial pressure of 02. Partial pressure of C02, hydrogen ion
concentration and temperature are the other factors which can interfere
with this binding. A sigmoid curve is obtained when percentage saturation
of haemoglobin with O2 is plotted against the
p02. This curve is called the Oxygen
dissociation curve (Figure 17 .5) and is highly
useful in studying the effect of factors like
pCO2, H“ concentration, etc., on binding of 02
with haemoglobin. In the alveoli, where there
is high p02, low pCOZ, lesser H+ concentration
and lower temperature, the factors are
all favourable for the formation of
oxyhaemoglobin, whereas in the tissues,

conditions.

17.4.2 Transport of Carbon dioxide

CO2 is carried by haemoglobin as carbamino-haemoglobin (about
20-25 per cent). This binding is related to the partial pressure of 002.
p02 is a major factor which could affect this binding. When pCO2 is high
and p02 is low as in the tissues, more binding of carbon dioxide occurs
whereas, when the pCO2 is low and p02 is high as in the alveoli, dissociation
