Katherine Esau
(1898 — 1997)

KATHERINE ESAU was born in Ukraine in 1898. She studied
agriculture in Russia and Germany and received her doctorate
in 193 1 in United States. She reported in her early publications
that the curly top virus spreads through a plant via the food-
conducting or phloem tissue. Dr Esau’s PlantAnatomy published
in 1954 took a dynamic, developmental approach designed to
enhance one’s understanding of plant structure and an
enormous impact worldwide, literally bringing about a revival
of the discipline. The Anatomy of Seed Plants by Katherine Esau
was published in 1960. It was referred to as Webster’s of plant
biology — it is encyclopediac. In 1957 she was elected to the
National Academy of Sciences, becoming the sixth woman to
receive that honour. In addition to this prestigious award, she
received the National Medal of Science from President George
Bush in 1989.

When Katherine Esau died in the year 1997 , Peter Raven,
director of Anatomy and Morphology, Missouri Botanical
Garden, remembered that she ‘absolutely dominated’ the field
of plant biology even at the age of 99.
