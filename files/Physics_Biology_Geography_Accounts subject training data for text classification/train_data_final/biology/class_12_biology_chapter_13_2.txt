ORGANISMS AND POPULATIONS

1 3.1 Organism and Its
Environment

13.2 Populations

Our living world is fascinatingly diverse and amazingly
complex. We can try to understand its complexity by
investigating processes at various levels of biological
organisation—macromolecules, cells, tissues, organs,
individual organisms, population, communities,
ecosystems and biomes. At any level of biological
organisation we can ask two types of questions — for
example, when we hear the bulbul singing early morning
in the garden, we may ask — ‘How does the bird sing?’
Or, ‘Why does the bird sing ?’ The ‘how—type’ questions
seek the mechanism behind the process while the ‘why-
type’ questions seek the signiﬁcance of the process. For
the ﬁrst question in our example, the answer might be in
terms of the operation of the voice box and the vibrating
bone in the bird, whereas for the second question the
answer may lie in the bird’s need to communicate with its
mate during breeding season. When you observe nature
around you with a scientific frame of mind you will
certainly come up with many interesting questions of both
types - Why are night-blooming ﬂowers generally white?
How does the bee know which ﬂower has nectar? Why
does cactus have so many thorns? How does the chick
spures recognise her own mother?, and so on.
