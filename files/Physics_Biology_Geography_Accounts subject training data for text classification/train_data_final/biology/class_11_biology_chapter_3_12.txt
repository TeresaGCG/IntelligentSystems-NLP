nuclei eventually fuse to produce a diploid secondary nucleus. Pollen
grain, after dispersal from the anthers, are carried by wind or various other
agencies to the stigma of a pistil. This is termed as pollination. The pollen
grains germinate on the stigma and the resulting pollen tubes grow through
the tissues of stigma and style and reach the ovule. The pollen tubes enter
the embryo-sac where two male gametes are discharged. One of the male
gametes fuses with the egg cell (syngamy) to form a zygote. The other male
gamete fuses with the diploid secondary nucleus to produce the triploid
primary endosperm nucleus PEN). Because of the occurrence of two
fusions i.e., syngamy and triple fusion, this event is termed as double
fertilisation, an event unique to angiosperms. The zygote develops into
an embryo (with one or two cotyledons) and the PEN develops into
endosperm which provides nourishment to the developing embryo. The
synergids and antipodals degenerate after fertilisation. During these events
the ovules develop into seeds and the ovaries develop into fruit. The life
cycle of an angiosperm is shown in Figure 3.6.
