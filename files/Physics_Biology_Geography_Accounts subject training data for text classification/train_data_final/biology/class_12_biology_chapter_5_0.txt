Molecular Basis of Inheritance

Chapter 7
Evolution

The work of Mendel and others who followed him gave us an
idea of inheritance patterns. However the nature of those ‘factors’
which determine the phenotype was not very clear. As these
‘factors’ represent the genetic basis of inheritance, understanding
the structure of genetic material and the structural basis of
genotype and phenotype conversion became the focus of
attention in biology for the next century. The entire body of
molecular biology was a consequent development with major
contributions from Watson, Crick, Nirenberg, Khorana, Kornbergs
(father and son), Benzer, Monod, Brenner, etc. A parallel problem
being tackled was the mechanism of evolution. Awareness in the
areas of molecular genetics, structural biology and bio informatics
have enriched our understanding of the molecular basis of
evolution. In this unit the structure and function of DNA and the
story and theory of evolution have been examined and explained.
