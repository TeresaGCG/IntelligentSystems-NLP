the nephron (Arrows indicate direction of movement of materials.)

Collecting Duct: This long duct extends from the cortex of the kidney
to the inner parts of the medulla. Large amounts of water could be
reabsorbed from this region to produce a concentrated urine. This segment
allows passage of small amounts of urea into the medullary interstitium
to keep up the osmolarity. It also plays a role in the maintenance of pH
and ionic balance of blood by the selective secretion of H+ and K+ ions
(Figure 19.5).

19.4 MECHANISM OF CONCENTRATION OF THE FILTRATE

Mammals have the ability to produce a concentrated urine. The Henle’s
loop and vasa recta play a significant role in this. The ﬂow of ﬁltrate in
the two limbs of Henle’s loop is in opposite directions and thus forms a
counter current. The ﬂow of blood through the two limbs of vasa recta is
