BREATHING AND EXCHANGE OF GASES

As you have read earlier, oxygen (02) is utilised by the organisms to
indirectly break down simple molecules like glucose, amino acids, fatty
acids, etc., to derive energy to perform various activities. Carbon dioxide
(C02) which is harmful is also released during the above catabolic
reactions. It is, therefore, evident that 02 has to be continuously provided
to the cells and CO2 produced by the cells have to be released out. This
process of exchange of 02 from the atmosphere with CO2 produced by the
cells is called breathing, commonly known as respiration. Place your
hands on your chest; you can feel the chest moving up and down. You
know that it is due to breathing. How do we breathe? The respiratory
organs and the mechanism of breathing are described in the following
sections of this chapter.

17.1 RESPIRATORY ORGANS

Mechanisms of breathing vary among different groups of animals
depending mainly on their habitats and levels of organisation. Lower
invertebrates like sponges, coelenterates, ﬂatworms, etc., exchange 02
with CO2 by simple diffusion over their entire body surface. Earthworms
use their moist cuticle and insects have a network of tubes (tracheal
tubes) to transport atmospheric air within the body. Special vascularised
structures called gills (branchial respiration) are used by most of the
aquatic arthropods and molluscs whereas vascularised bags called lungs
(pulmonary respiration) are used by the terrestrial forms for the exchange
of gases. Among vertebrates, ﬁshes use gills whereas amphibians, reptiles,
birds and mammals respire through lungs. Amphibians like frogs can
respire through their moist skin (cutaneous respiration) also.
