CELL CYCLE AND CELL DIVISION

Prophase I Metaphase 1
Anaphase 1

Figure 10.3 Stages of Meiosis I

Anaphase I: The homologous chromosomes separate, while sister
chromatids remain associated at their centromeres (Figure 10.3).

Telophase I: The nuclear membrane and nucleolus reappear, cytokinesis
follows and this is called as dyad of cells (Figure 10.3). Although in many
cases the chromosomes do undergo some dispersion, they do not reach
the extremely extended state of the interphase nucleus. The stage between
the two meiotic divisions is called interkinesis and is generally short lived.
There is no replication of DNA during interkinesis. Interkinesis is followed
by prophase II, a much simpler prophase than prophase 1.

10.4.2 Meiosis II

Prophase II: Meiosis II is initiated immediately after cytokinesis, usually
before the chromosomes have fully elongated. In contrast to meiosis I,
meiosis II resembles a normal mitosis. The nuclear membrane disappears
by the end of prophase 11 (Figure 10.4). The chromosomes again become
compact.

Metaphase II: At this stage the chromosomes align at the equator and
the microtubules from opposite poles of the spindle get attached to the
kinetochores (Figure 10.4) of sister chromatids.

Anaphase II: It begins with the simultaneous splitting of the centromere
of each chromosome (which was holding the sister chromatids together),
allowing them to move toward opposite poles of the cell (Figure 10.4) by
shortening of microtubules attached to kinetochores.
