As each cell of the sporogenous tissue is capable of giving rise to a
microspore tetrad. Each one is a potential pollen or microspore mother
cell. The process of formation of microspores from a pollen mother cell (PMC)
through meiosis is called microsporogenesis. The microspores, as they
are formed, are arranged in a cluster of four cells—the microspore tetrad
(Figure 2.3 a). As the anthers mature and dehydrate, the microspores
dissociate from each other and develop into pollen grains (Figure 2.3 b).
Inside each microsporangium several thousands of microspores or pollen
grains are formed that are released with the dehiscence of anther
(Figure 2.3 c).

Pollen grain: The pollen grains represent the male gametophytes. If you
touch the opened anthers of Hibiscus or any other ﬂower you would ﬁnd
deposition of yellowish powdery pollen grains on your ﬁngers. Sprinkle
these grains on a drop of water taken on a glass slide and observe under
