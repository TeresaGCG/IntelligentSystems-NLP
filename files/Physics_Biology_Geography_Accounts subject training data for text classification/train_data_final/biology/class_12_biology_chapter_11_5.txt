strain. Roman numbers following the names indicate the order in which
the enzymes were isolated from that strain of bacteria.

Restriction enzymes belong to a larger class of enzymes called
nucleases. These are of two kinds; exonucleases and endonucleases.
Exonucleases remove nucleotides from the ends of the DNA whereas,
endonucleases make cuts at speciﬁc positions within the DNA.

Each restriction endonuclease functions by ‘inspecting’ the length of
a DNA sequence. Once it finds its speciﬁc recognition sequence, it
will bind to the DNA and cut each of the two strands of the double
helix at specific points in their sugar-phosphate backbones
(Figure 11.1). Each restriction endonuclease recognises a specific
palindromic nucleotide sequences in the DNA.

Do you know what palindromes are? These are groups of letters
that form the same words when read both forward and backward,
e.g., MALAYALAM’. As against a word-palindrome where the same
word is read in both directions, the palindrome in DNA is a sequence
of base pairs that reads same on the two strands when orientation of
