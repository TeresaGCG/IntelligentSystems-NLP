Technology

1 1.3 Processes of Recombinant
DNA Technology

Biotechnology deals with techniques of using live
organisms or enzymes from organisms to produce products
and processes useful to humans. In this sense, making
curd, bread or wine, which are all microbe-mediated
processes, could also be thought as a form Of
biotechnology. However, it is used in a restricted sense
today, to refer to such Of those processes which use
genetically modiﬁed organisms to achieve the same on a
larger scale. Further, many other processes / techniques are
also included under biotechnology. For example, in vitro
fertilisation leading to a ‘test-tube’ baby, synthesising a
gene and using it, developing a DNA vaccine or correcting
a defective gene, are all part Of biotechnology.

The European Federation of Biotechnology (EFB) has
given a deﬁnition of biotechnology that encompasses both
traditional View and modern molecular biotechnology.
The deﬁnition given by EFB is as follows:

The integration Of natural science and organisms,
cells, parts thereof, and molecular analogues for products
and services’.

1 1. l PRINCIPLES OF BIOTECHNOLOGY

Among many, the two core techniques that enabled birth
of modern biotechnology are :

(i) Genetic engineering :Techniques to alter the
chemistry of genetic material (DNA and RNA),
