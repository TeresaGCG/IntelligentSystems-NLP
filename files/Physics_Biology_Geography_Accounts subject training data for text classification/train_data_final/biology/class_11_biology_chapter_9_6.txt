etc. (Table 9.5). Collagen is the most abundant protein in animal world
and Ribulose bisphosphate Carboxylase-Oxygenase (RuBisCO) is the
most abundant protein in the Whole of the biosphere.

9.5 POLYSACCHARIDES

The acid insoluble pellet also has polysaccharides (carbohydrates) as
another class of macromolecules. Polysaccharides are long chains of
sugars. They are threads (literally a cotton thread) containing different
monosaccharides as building blocks. For example, cellulose is a
polymeric polysaccharide consisting of only one type of monosaccharide
i.e., glucose. Cellulose is a homopolymer. Starch is a variant of this but
present as a store house of energy in plant tissues. Animals have another
variant called glycogen. Inulin is a polymer of fructose. In a
polysaccharide chain (say glycogen), the right end is called the reducing
end and the left end is called the non-reducing end. It has branches as
shown in the form of a cartoon (Figure 9.2). Starch forms helical
secondary structures. In fact, starch can hold I2 molecules in the helical
portion. The starch-I2 is blue in colour. Cellulose does not contain
complex helices and hence cannot hold 12.
