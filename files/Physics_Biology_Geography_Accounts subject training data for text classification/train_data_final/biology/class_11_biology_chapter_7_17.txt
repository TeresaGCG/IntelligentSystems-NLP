leads to the oesophagus through pharynx. Oesophagus is a short tube
that opens into the stomach which in turn continues as the intestine, rectum
and ﬁnally opens outside by the Cloaca. Liver secretes bile that is stored in
the gall bladder. Pancreas, a digestive gland produces pancreatic juice
containing digestive enzymes. Food is captured by the bilobed tongue.
Digestion of food takes place by the action of HCl and gastric juices secreted
from the walls of the stomach. Partially digested food called chyme is passed
from stomach to the ﬁrst part of the small intestine, the duodenum. The
duodenum receives bile from gall bladder and pancreatic juices from the
pancreas through a common bile duct. Bile emulsiﬁes fat and pancreatic
juices digest carbohydrates and proteins. Final digestion takes place in the
intestine. Digested food is absorbed by the numerous ﬁnger-like folds in
the inner wall of intestine called villi and microvilli. The undigested solid
waste moves into the rectum and passes out through Cloaca.

Frogs respire on land and in the water by two different methods. In
water, skin acts as aquatic respiratory organ (cutaneous respiration).
Dissolved oxygen in the water is exchanged through the skin by diffusion.
