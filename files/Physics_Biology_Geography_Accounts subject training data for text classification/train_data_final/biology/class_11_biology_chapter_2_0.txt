BIOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION

Since the dawn of civilisation, there have been many attempts to classify
living organisms. It was done instinctively not using criteria that were
scientiﬁc but borne out of a need to use organisms for our own use — for
food, shelter and clothing. Aristotle was the earliest to attempt a more
scientiﬁc basis for classiﬁcation. He used simple morphological characters
to classify plants into trees, shrubs and herbs. He also divided animals
into two groups, those which had red blood and those that did not.

In Linnaeus' time a Two Kingdom system of classification with
Plantae and Animalia kingdoms was developed that included all
plants and animals respectively. This system did not distinguish between
the eukaryotes and prokaryotes, unicellular and multicellular organisms
and photosynthetic (green algae) and non-photosynthetic (fungi)
organisms. Classiﬁcation of organisms into plants and animals was easily
done and was easy to understand, but, a large number of organisms
did not fall into either category. Hence the two kingdom classification
used for a long time was found inadequate. Besides, gross morphology
a need was also felt for including other characteristics like cell structure,
nature of wall, mode of nutrition, habitat, methods of reproduction,
evolutionary relationships, etc. Classification systems for the living
organisms have hence, undergone several changes over the time.
Though plant and animal kingdoms have been a constant under all
different systems, the understanding of what groups /organisms be
included under these kingdoms have been changing; the number and
nature of other kingdoms have also been understood differently by
different scientists over the time.
