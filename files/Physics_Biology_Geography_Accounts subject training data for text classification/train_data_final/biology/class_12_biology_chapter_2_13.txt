leads to fertilisation. If the pollen is of the wrong type, the pistil rejects the

pollen by preventing pollen germination on the stigma or the pollen tube

growth in the style. The ability of the pistil to recognise the pollen followed

by its acceptance or rejection is the result of a continuous dialogue

between pollen grain and the pistil. This dialogue is mediated by chemical

components of the pollen interacting with those of the pistil. It is only in

recent years that botanists have been able to identify some of the pollen

— and pistil components and the interactions leading to the recognition,
followed by acceptance or rejection.

As mentioned earlier, following compatible pollination, the pollen grain

germinates on the stigma to produce a pollen tube through one of the
germ pores (Figure 2.12a). The contents of the pollen grain move into the
