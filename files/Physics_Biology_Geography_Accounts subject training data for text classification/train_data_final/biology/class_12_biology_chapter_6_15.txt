and polymerises in a template depended fashion following the rule of
complementarity. It somehow also facilitates opening of the helix and
continues elongation. Only a short stretch of RNA remains bound to the
enzyme. Once the polymerases reaches the terminator region, the nascent
RNA falls off, so also the RNA polymerase. This results in termination of
transcription.

An intriguing question is that how is the RNA polymerases able
to catalyse all the three steps, which are initiation, elongation and
termination. The RNA polymerase is only capable of catalysing the
process of elongation. It associates transiently With initiation-factor (o)
and termination-factor (p) to initiate and terminate the transcription,
respectively. Association With these factors alter the specificity of the
RNA polymerase to either initiate or terminate (Figure 6.10).

In bacteria, since the mRNA does not require any processing to become
active, and also since transcription and translation take place in the same
compartment (there is no separation of cytosol and nucleus in bacteria),
many times the translation can begin much before the mRNA is fully
transcribed. Consequently, the transcription and translation can be coupled
in bacteria.

In eukaryotes, there are two additional complexities —

(i) There are at least three RNA polymerases in the nucleus (in addition
to the RNA polymerase found in the organelles). There is a clear
cut division of labour. The RNA polymerase I transcribes rRNAs
