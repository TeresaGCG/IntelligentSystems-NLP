BIOLOGY

(Figure 6.7 a). Covered with a thin layer of cuticle, it may bear trichomes and
a few stomata. The cells arranged in multiple layers between epidermis and
pericycle constitute the cortex. It consists of three sub-zones. The outer
hypodermis, consists of a few layers of collenchymatous cells just below the
epidermis, which provide mechanical strength to the young stem. Cortical
layers below hypodermis consist of rounded thin walled parenchymatous
cells with conspicuous intercellular spaces. The innermost layer of the cortex

is called the endodermis. The cells of the endodermis are rich in starch
grains and the laver is also referred to as the starch sheath. Pericvcle is
