a gradient is present for CO2 in the opposite direction, i.e., from tissues to
blood and blood to alveoli. As the solubility of CO2 is 20-25 times higher
than that of 02, the amount of CO2 that can diffuse through the diffusion
membrane per unit difference in partial pressure is much higher compared
to that of 02. The diffusion membrane
is made up of three major layers
(Figure 17 .4) namely, the thin squamous
epithelium of alveoli, the endothelium of Squamous epithelium 7.
