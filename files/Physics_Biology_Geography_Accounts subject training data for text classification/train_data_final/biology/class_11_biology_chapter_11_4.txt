diffusion is very speciﬁc: it allows cell to
select substances for uptake. It is
sensitive to inhibitors which react with
protein side chains.

The proteins form channels in the
membrane for molecules to pass through.
Some channels are always open; others
can be controlled. Some are large,
allowing a variety of molecules to cross.
The porins are proteins that form large
pores in the outer membranes of the
plastids, mitochondria and some bacteria
allowing molecules up to the size of small
proteins to pass through.

Figure l 1.1 shows an extracellular
molecule bound to the transport protein;
the transport protein then rotates and
releases the molecule inside the cell, e. g.,
water channels — made up of eight
different types of aquaporins.

11.1.2.1 Passive symports and
antiports

Some carrier or transport proteins allow
diffusion only if two types of molecules
move together. In a symport, both
molecules cross the membrane in the same
direction; in an antiport, they move in
opposite directions (Figure 1 1.2). When a
