ANIMAL KINGDOM

4.2.3 Phylum — Ctenophora

Ctenophores, commonly known as sea walnuts or comb jellies
are exclusively marine, radially symmetrical, diploblastic
organisms with tissue level of organisation. The body bears
eight external rows of ciliated comb plates, which help in
locomotion (Figure 4.8). Digestion is both extracellular and
intracellular. Bioluminescence (the property of a living
organism to emit light) is well-marked in ctenophores. Sexes
are not separate. Reproduction takes place only by sexual
means. Fertilisation is external with indirect development.

Examples: Pleurobrachia and Ctenoplana.

4.2.4 Phylum - Platyhelminthes

They have dorso-ventrally ﬂattened body, hence are called
ﬂatworms (Figure 4.9). These are mostly endoparasites found
in animals including human beings. Flatworms are bilaterally
symmetrical, triploblastic and acoelomate animals with organ
level of organisation. Hooks and suckers are present in the
parasitic forms. Some of them absorb nutrients from the host
directly through their body surface. Specialised cells called
ﬂame cells help in osmoregulation and excretion. Sexes are not
separate. Fertilisation is internal and development is through
many larval stages. Some members like Planaria possess high
regeneration capacity.

Examples: Taenia (Tapeworm), Fasciola (Liver ﬂuke).
