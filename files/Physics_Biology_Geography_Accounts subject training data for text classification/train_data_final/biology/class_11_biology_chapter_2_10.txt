Figure 2.6 (a) Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV) (b) Bacteriophage

Once they infect a cell they take over the machinery of the host cell to replicate
themselves, killing the host. Would you call viruses living or non-living?

The name virus that means venom or poisonous ﬂuid was given by
Dmitri Ivanowsky (1892) recognised certain microbes as causal organism
of the mosaic disease of tobacco (Figure 2.6a). These were found to be
smaller than bacteria because they passed through bacteria-proof ﬁlters.
M.W. Beijerinek (1898) demonstrated that the extract of the infected plants
of tobacco could cause infection in healthy plants and called the ﬂuid as
Contagium vivumﬂuidum (infectious living ﬂuid). W.M. Stanley (1935)
showed that Viruses could be crystallised and crystals consist largely of
proteins. They are inert outside their speciﬁc host cell. Viruses are obligate
parasites.

In addition to proteins, viruses also contain genetic material, that could
be either RNA or DNA. No virus contains both RNA and DNA. A virus is
a nucleoprotein and the genetic material is infectious. In general, viruses
that infect plants have single stranded RNA and viruses that infect animals
have either single or double stranded RNA or double stranded DNA.
Bacterial viruses or bacteriophages (viruses that infect the bacteria) are
usually double stranded DNA viruses (Figure 2.6b). The protein coat
called capsid made of small subunits called capsomeres, protects the
nucleic acid. These capsomeres are arranged in helical or polyhedral
geometric forms. Viruses cause diseases like mumps, small pox, herpes
and inﬂuenza. AIDS in humans is also caused by a virus. In plants, the
symptoms can be mosaic formation, leaf rolling and curling, yellowing
and vein clearing, dwarﬂng and stunted growth.
