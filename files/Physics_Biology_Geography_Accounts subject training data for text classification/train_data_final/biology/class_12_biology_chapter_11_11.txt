1 1.3.2 Cutting of DNA at Speciﬁc Locations

 

Restriction enzyme digestions are performed by incubating puriﬁed DNA
molecules with the restriction enzyme, at the optimal conditions for that
speciﬁc enzyme. Agarose gel electrophoresis is employed to check the
progression of a restriction enzyme digestion. DNA is a negatively charged
molecule, hence it moves towards the positive electrode (anode)
(Figure 1 1.3). The process is repeated with the vector DNA also.

The joining of DNA involves several processes. After having cut the
source DNA as well as the vector DNA with a speciﬁc restriction enzyme,
the cut out ‘gene of interest’ from the source DNA and the cut vector with
space are mixed and ligase is added. This results in the preparation of
recombinant DNA.

1 1.3.3 Ampliﬁcation of Gene of Interest using PCR

PCR stands for Polymerase Chain Reaction. In this reaction, multiple
copies of the gene (or DNA) of interest is synthesised in vitro using two
