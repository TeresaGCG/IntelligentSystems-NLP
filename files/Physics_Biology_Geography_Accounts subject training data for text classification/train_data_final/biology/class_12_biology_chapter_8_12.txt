sexual partners, drug addicts who take drugs intravenously, individuals
who require repeated blood transfusions and children born to an HIV
infected mother. Do you know—when do people need repeated blood

to note that HIV/AIDS is not spread by mere touch or physical contact; it
spreads only through body ﬂuids. It is, hence, imperative, for the physical
and psychological well-being, that the HIV/AIDS infected persons are
not isolated from family and society. There is always a time-lag between
the infection and appearance of AIDS symptoms. This period may vary
from a few months to many years (usually 5- 10 years).
