membrane and release their neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft. The
released neurotransmitters bind to their speciﬁc receptors, present on
the post-synaptic membrane. This binding opens ion channels allowing
the entry of ions which can generate a new potential in the post-synaptic
neuron. The new potential developed may be either excitatory or
inhibitory.

21.4 CENTRAL NEURAL SYSTEM

The brain is the central information processing organ of our body, and
acts as the ‘command and control system’. It controls the voluntary
movements, balance of the body, functioning of vital involuntary organs
(e. g., lungs, heart, kidneys, etc.), thermoregulation, hunger and thirst,
circadian (24-hour) rhythms of our body, activities of several endocrine
glands and human behaviour. It is also the site for processing of vision,
hearing, speech, memory, intelligence, emotions and thoughts.

The human brain is well protected by the skull. Inside the skull, the
brain is covered by cranial meninges consisting of an outer layer called
dura mater, a very thin middle layer called arachnoid and an inner layer
(which is in contact with the brain tissue) called pia mater. The brain can
be divided into three major parts: (i) forebrain, (ii) midbrain, and
(iii) hindbrain (Figure 2 1.4).
