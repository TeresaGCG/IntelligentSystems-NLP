2 1.5 REFLEX ACTION AND REFLEX ARC

You must have experienced a sudden withdrawal of a body part which
comes in contact with objects that are extremely hot, cold pointed or
animals that are scary or poisonous. The entire process of response to a
peripheral nervous stimulation, that occurs involuntarily, i.e., without
conscious effort or thought and requires the involvment of a part of the
central nervous system is called a reﬂex action. The reﬂex pathway
comprises at least one afferent neuron (receptor) and one efferent (effector
or excitor) neuron appropriately arranged in a series (Figure 2 1.5). The
afferent neuron receives signal from a sensory organ and transmits the
impulse via a dorsal nerve root into the CNS (at the level of spinal cord).
The efferent nueuron then carries signals from CNS to the effector. The
stimulus and response thus forms a reﬂex arc as shown below in the
knee jerk reﬂex. You should carefully study Figure 2 1.5 to understand
the mechanism of a knee jerk reﬂex.

21.6 SENSORY RECEPTION AND PROCESSING

Have you ever thought how do you feel the climatic changes in the
environment? How do you see an object and its colour? How do you
hear a sound? The sensory organs detect all types of changes in the
environment and send appropriate signals to the CNS, where all the inputs
are processed and analysed. Signals are then sent to different parts/
centres of the brain. This is how you can sense changes in the environment.
