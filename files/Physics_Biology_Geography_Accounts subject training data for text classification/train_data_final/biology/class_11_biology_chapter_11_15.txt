BIOLOGY

The transpiration driven ascent of xylem sap depends mainly on the
following physical properties of water:

° Cohesion — mutual attraction between water molecules.

° Adhesion — attraction of water molecules to polar surfaces (such
as the surface of tracheary elements).

° Surface Tension — water molecules are attracted to each other in
the liquid phase more than to water in the gas phase.

These properties give water high tensile strength, i.e., an ability to
resist a pulling force, and high capillarity, i.e., the ability to rise in thin
tubes. In plants capillarity is aided by the small diameter of the tracheary
elements — the tracheids and vessel elements.

The process of photosynthesis requires water. The system of xylem
vessels from the root to the leaf vein can supply the needed water. But
what force does a plant use to move water molecules into the leaf
parenchyma cells where they are needed? As water evaporates through
the stomata, since the thin film of water over the cells is continuous, it
results in pulling of water, molecule by molecule, into the leaf from the
xylem. Also, because of lower concentration of water vapour in the
atmosphere as compared to the substomatal cavity and intercellular
spaces, water diffuses into the surrounding air. This creates a ‘pull’
(Figure 1 1.9).

Measurements reveal that the forces generated by transpiration can
create pressures sufﬁcient to lift a xylem sized column of water over 130
metres high.

a pressure gradient between the outside air and the air spaces of the
leaf. The gradient is transmitted into the photosynthetic cells and on
the water-filled xylem in the leaf vein.
