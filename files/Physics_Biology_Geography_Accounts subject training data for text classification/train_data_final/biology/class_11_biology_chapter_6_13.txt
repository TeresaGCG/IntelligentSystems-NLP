to phellogen and ultimately these
layers die and slough off. Bark is a
non-technical term that refers to all
tissues exterior to the vascular
cambium, therefore including
secondary phloem. Bark refers to a
number of tissue types, viz.,
periderm and secondary phloem.
Bark that is formed early in the
season is called early or soft bark.
Towards the end of the season, late
or hard bark is formed. Name the
various kinds of cell layers which
constitute the bark. (a)

At certain regions, the phellogen
cuts off closely arranged
parenchymatous cells on the outer
side instead of cork cells. These
parenchymatous cells soon rupture
the epidermis, forming a lens-
shaped openings called lenticels.
Lenticels permit the exchange of
gases between the outer atmosphere
and the internal tissue of the stem.
These occur in most woody trees
(Figure 6.10).

6.4.3 Secondary Growth in
Roots

 

In the dicot root, the vascular
cambium is completely secondary in
origin. It originates from the tissue
located just below the phloem
bundles, a portion of pericycle tissue,
above the protoxylem forming a
complete and continuous wavy ring,
which later becomes circular (Figure
6.1 1). Further events are similar to
those already described above for a
dicotyledon stem.
