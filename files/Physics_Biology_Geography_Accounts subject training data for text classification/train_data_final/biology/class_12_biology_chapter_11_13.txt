active log/ exponential phase. This type of culturing method produces a
larger biomass leading to higher yields of desired protein.

Small volume cultures cannot yield appreciable quantities of products.
To produce in large quantities, the development of bioreactors, where
large volumes (100- 1000 litres) of culture can be processed, was required.
Thus, bioreactors can be thought of as vessels in which raw materials are
biologically converted into speciﬁc products, individual enzymes, etc.,
using microbial plant, animal or human cells. A bioreactor provides the
optimal conditions for achieving the desired product by providing
optimum growth conditions (temperature, pH, substrate, salts, vitamins,
oxygen).

The most commonly used bioreactors are of stirring type, which are
shown in Figure 1 1.7.

A stirred-tank reactor is usually cylindrical or with a curved base to
facilitate the mixing of the reactor contents. The stirrer facilitates even
mixing and oxygen availability throughout the bioreactor. Alternatively
air can be bubbled through the reactor. If you look at the ﬁgure closely
you will see that the bioreactor has an agitator system, an oxygen delivery
system and a foam control system, a temperature control system, pH
control system and sampling ports so that small volumes of the culture
can be withdrawn periodically.

After completion of the biosynthetic stage, the product has to be subjected
through a series of processes before it is ready for marketing as a ﬁnished
