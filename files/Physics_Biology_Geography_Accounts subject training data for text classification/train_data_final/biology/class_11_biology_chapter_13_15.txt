TABLE 13. 1 Fill in the Columns 2 and 3 in this table to highlight the differences
between C3 and C 4 Plants

Characteristics

Cell type in which the Calvin
cycle takes place

Cell type in which the initial
carboxylation reaction occurs

How many cell types does the
leaf have that fix CO2.

Which is the primary CO2 acceptor

Number of carbons in the
primary CO2 acceptor

Which is the primary CO2
fixation product

No. of carbons in the primary
CO2 Ô¨Åxation product

Does the plant have RuBisCO?

Does the plant have PEP Case?

Rubisco?

different plants and observe under
the microscope for Kranz anatomy

and list them in the appropriate
columns.
