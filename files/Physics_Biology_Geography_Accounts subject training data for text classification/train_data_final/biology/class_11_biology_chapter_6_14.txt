Figure 6.11 Different stages of the secondary growth in a typical dicot root

Secondary growth also occurs in stems and roots of gymnosperms.
However, secondary growth does not occur in monocotyledons.

SUMMARY

Anatomically, a plant is made of different kinds of tissues. The plant tissues are
broadly classiﬁed into meristematic (apical, lateral and intercalary) and permanent
(simple and complex). Assimilation of food and its storage, transportation of water,
minerals and photosynthates, and mechanical support are the main functions of
tissues. There are three types oftissue Systems — epidermal, ground and vascular.
The epidermal tissue systems are made of epidermal cells, stomata and the
epidermal appendages. The ground tissue system forms the main bulk of the
plant. It is divided into three Zones — cortex, pericycle and pith. The vascular
tissue system is formed by the xylem and phloem. On the basis of presence of
cambium, location of xylem and phloem, the vascular bundles are of different
types. The vascular bundles form the conducting tissue and translocate water,
minerals and food material.
