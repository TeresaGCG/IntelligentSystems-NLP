RESPIRATION IN PLANTS

When fats are used in respiration, the R9 is less than 1. Calculations

for a fatty acid, tripalmitin, if used as a substrate is shown:

 

When proteins are respiratory substrates the ratio would be about
0.9.
What is important to recognise is that in living organisms respiratory

substrates are often more than one; pure proteins or fats are never used
as respiratory substrates.

SUMMARY

Plants unlike animals have no special systems for breathing or gaseous exchange.
Stomata and lenticels allow gaseous exchange by diffusion. Almost all living cells
in a plant have their surfaces exposed to air.

The breaking of C- C bonds of complex organic molecules by oxidation cells
leading to the release of a lot of ener‘r is called cellular respiration. Glucose 1s the
favoured substrate for respiration. Fats and proteins can also be broken down to
yield energy. The initial stage'z'of cellular respiration takes place in the cytoplasm.
Each glucose moleculefisbmken through a series of enzyme catalysed reactions
into two molecules of pyruVic acid. This process is called glycolysis. The fate of the
pyruvate depends‘on the availability of oxygen and the organism. Under anaerobic
conditions eithei‘r, lactic acid fermentation or alcohol fermentation occurs.
Fermentation takes place under anaerobic conditions in many prokaryotes,
unicellular eukaryotes and in germinating seeds. In eukaryotic organisms aerobic
respiration occurs in the presence of oxygen. Pyruvic acid is transported into the
mitochondria where it is converted into acetyl CoA with the release of C02. Acetyl
CoA then enters the tricarboxylic acid pathway or Krebs’ cycle operating in the
matrix of the mitochondria. NADH + H’“ and FADH2 are generated in the Krebs’
cycle. The energy in these molecules as well as that in the NADH + H” synthesised
during glycolysis are used to synthesise ATP. This is accomplished through a
