CELL: THE UNIT OF LIFE

You may recall that the interphase nucleus has a loose
and indistinct network of nucleoprotein ﬁbres called
chromatin. But during different stages of cell division, cells
show structured chromosomes in place of the nucleus.
Chromatin contains DNA and some basic proteins called
histones, some non-histone proteins and also RNA. A
single human cell has approximately two metre long
thread of DNA distributed among its forty six (twenty three
pairs) chromosomes. You will study the details of DNA
packaging in the form of a chromosome in class XII.

Every chromosome (visible only in dividing cells)
essentially has a primary constriction or the centromere
on the sides of which disc shaped structures called
kinetochores are present Wigure 8. 12). Centromere holds
two chromatids of a chromosome. Based on the position
of the centromere, the chromosomes can be classiﬁed into
four types (Figure 8.13). The metacentric chromosome
has middle centromere forming two equal arms of the
chromosome. The sub-metacentric chromosome has
centromere slightly away from the middle of the
chromosome resulting into one shorter arm and one
longer arm. In case of acrocentric chromosome the
centromere is situated close to its end forming one
extremely short and one very long arm, whereas the
telocentric chromosome has a terminal centromere.
