BIOLOGY

called free central. In basal placentation, the placenta develops at the
base of ovary and a single ovule is attached to it, as in sunﬂower, marigold.

5.6 THE FRUIT

The fruit is a characteristic feature of the ﬂowering plants. It is a mature
or ripened ovary, developed after fertilisation. If a fruit is formed without
fertilisation of the ovary, it is called a parthenocarpic fruit.

Generally, the fruit consists of a wall or pericarp and seeds. The
pericarp may be dry or ﬂeshy. When pericarp is thick and ﬂeshy, it is
differentiated into the outer epicarp, the middle mesocarp and the inner
endocarp.

In mango and coconut, the fruit is known as a drupe (Figure 5.17).
They develop from monocarpellary superior ovaries and are one seeded.
In mango the pericarp is well differentiated into an outer thin epicarp, a
middle ﬂeshy edible mesocarp and an inner stony hard endocarp. In
coconut which is also a drupe, the mesocarp is ﬁbrous.

5.7 THE SEED

The ovules after fertilisation, develop into seeds. A seed is made up of a
seed coat and an embryo. The embryo is made up of a radicle, an embryonal
axis and one (as in wheat, maize) or two cotyledons (as in gram and pea).

5.7. 1 Structure of a Dicotyledonous Seed

The outermost covering of a seed is the seed coat. The seed coat has two
layers, the outer testa and the inner tegmen. The hilum is a scar on the
seed coat through which the developing seeds were attached to the fruit.
Above the hilum is a small pore called the micropyle. Within the seed
