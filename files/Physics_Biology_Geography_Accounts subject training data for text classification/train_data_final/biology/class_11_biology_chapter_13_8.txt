Figure 13.7 ATP synthesis through chemiosmosis

(b) As electrons move through the photosystems, protons are transported
across the membrane. This happens because the primary accepter of
electron which is located towards the outer side of the membrane
transfers its electron not to an electron carrier but to an H carrier.
Hence, this molecule removes a proton from the stroma while
transporting an electron. When this molecule passes on its electron
to the electron carrier on the inner side of the membrane, the proton
is released into the inner side or the lumen side of the membrane.

(c) The NADP reductase enzyme is located on the stroma side of the
membrane. Along with electrons that come from the acceptor of
electrons of PS I, protons are necessary for the reduction of NADP’“ to
NADPH+ H’“. These protons are also removed from the stroma.

Hence, within the chloroplast, protons in the stroma decrease in
number, while in the lumen there is accumulation of protons. This creates
a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane as well as a measurable
decrease in pH in the lumen.

Why are we so interested in the proton gradient? This gradient is
important because it is the breakdown of this gradient that leads to the

synthesis of ATP. The gradient is broken down due to the movement of
protons across the membrane to the stroma through the transmembrane
