G.N. Ramachandran
(1922 — 200 l)

G.N. RAMACHANDRAN, an outstanding figure in the field of protein
structure, was the founder of the ‘Madras school’ of
conformational analysis of biopolymers. His discovery of the triple
helical structure of collagen published in Nature in 1954 and his
analysis of the allowed conformations of proteins through the
use of the ‘Ramachandran plot’ rank among the most outstanding
contributions in structural biology. He was born on October 8,
1922, in a small town, not far from Cochin on the southwestern
coast of India. His father was a professor of mathematics at a
local college and thus had considerable inﬂuence in shaping
Ramachandran’s interest in mathematics. After completing his
school years, Ramachandran graduated in 1942 as the top-
ranking student in the B.Sc. (Honors) Physics course of the
University of Madras. He received a Ph.D. from Cambridge
University in 1949. While at Cambridge, Ramachandran met
Linus Pauling and was deeply inﬂuenced by his publications on
models of the oc-helix and B-sheet structures that directed his
attention to solving the structure of collagen. He passed away at
the age of 78, on April 7, 2001.
