Based on the position of calyx, corolla and androecium in respect of
the ovary on thalamus, the ﬂowers are described as hypogynous,
perigynous and epigynous (Figure 5.13). In the hypogynous ﬂower the
gynoecium occupies the highest position while the other parts are situated
below it. The ovary in such ﬂowers is said to be superior, e. g., mustard,
china rose and brinj a1. If gynoecium is situated in the centre and other
parts of the ﬂower are located on the rim of the thalamus almost at the
same level, it is called perigynous. The ovary here is said to be half
inferior, e.g., plum, rose, peach. In epigynous ﬂowers, the margin of
thalamus grows upward enclosing the ovary completely and getting fused
with it, the other parts of ﬂower arise above the ovary. Hence, the ovary is
said to be inferior as in ﬂowers of guava and cucumber, and the ray
ﬂorets of sunﬂower.

5.5. 1 Parts of a Flower

Each ﬂower normally has four ﬂoral whorls, viz., calyx, corolla,
androecium and gynoecium (Figure 5.14).

5.5.1.1 Calyx

The calyx is the outermost whorl of the ﬂower and the members are called
sepals. Generally, sepals are green, leaf like and protect the ﬂower in the
bud stage. The calyx may be gamosepalous (sepals united) or
polysepalous (sepals free).

5.5.1.2 Corolla

Corolla is composed of petals. Petals are usually brightly coloured to
attract insects for pollination. Like calyx, corolla may also be
