ANATOMY OF FLOWERING PLANTS

 

The cells of medullary rays, adjoining these intrafascicular cambium become
meristematic and form the interfascicular cambium. Thus, a continuous
ring of cambium is formed.

6.4.1.2 Activity of the cambial ring

The cambial ring becomes active and begins to cut off new cells, both
towards the inner and the outer sides. The cells cut off towards pith,
mature into secondary xylem and the cells cut off towards periphery
mature into secondary phloem. The cambium is generally more active
on the inner side than on the outer. As a result, the amount of secondary
xylem produced is more than secondary phloem and soon forms a
compact mass. The primary and secondary phloems get gradually
crushed due to the continued formation and accumulation of secondary
xylem. The primary xylem however remains more or less intact, in or
around the centre. At some places, the cambium forms a narrow band of
parenchyma, which passes through the secondary xylem and the
secondary phloem in the radial directions. These are the secondary
medullary rays (Figure 6.9).
