Reproduction in Organisms organisms die without fail, species continue to live through

millions of years unless threatened by natural or anthropogenic
Chapter 2 extinction. Reproduction becomes a vital process without
SGXUCJI Reproduction in which species cannot survive for long. Each individual leaves
flowering Plants its progeny by asexual or sexual means. Sexual mode of

reproduction enables creation of new variants, so that survival
advantage is enhanced. This unit examines the general
principles underlying reproductive processes in living organisms
and then explains the details of this process in flowering plants
and humans as easy to relate representative examples. A related
perspective on human reproductive health and how
reproductive ill health can be avoided is also presented to
