2.3 DOUBLE FERTILISATION

After entering one of the synergids, the pollen tube releases the two male
gametes into the cytoplasm of the synergid. One of the male gametes
moves towards the egg cell and fuses with its nucleus thus completing the
syngamy. This results in the formation of a diploid cell, the zygote. The
other male gamete moves towards the two polar nuclei located in the central
cell and fuses with them to produce a triploid primary endosperm nucleus
(PEN) Wigure 2.13a). As this involves the fusion of three haploid nuclei it
is termed triple fusion. Since two types of fusions, syngamy and triple
fusion take place in an embryo sac the phenomenon is termed double
fertilisation, an event unique to ﬂowering plants. The central cell after
triple fusion becomes the primary endosperm cell (PEG) and develops
into the endosperm while the zygote develops into an embryo.

2.4 POST-FERTILISATION : STRUCTURES AND EVENTS

Following double fertilisation, events of endosperm and embryo
development, maturation of ovule(s) into seed(s) and ovary into fruit, are
collectively termed post-fertilisation events.
