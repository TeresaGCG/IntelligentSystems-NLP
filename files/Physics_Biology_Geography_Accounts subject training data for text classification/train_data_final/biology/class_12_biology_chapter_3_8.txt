of each menstrual cycle. The major events of the menstrual cycle are
shown in Figure 3.9. The cycle starts with the menstrual phase, when
menstrual ﬂow occurs and it lasts for 3-5 days. The menstrual ﬂow
results due to breakdown of endometrial lining of the uterus and its
blood vessels which forms liquid that comes out through vagina.
Menstruation only occurs if the released ovum is not fertilised. Lack of
menstruation may be indicative of pregnancy. However, it may also be
caused due to some other underlying causes like stress, poor health etc.
The menstrual phase is followed by the follicular phase. During
— this phase, the primary follicles in the ovary grow to become a
fully mature Graaﬁan follicle and simultaneously the endometrium
of uterus regenerates through proliferation. These changes in the

ovary and the uterus are induced by changes in the levels of
pituitary and ovarian hormones (Figure 3.9). The secretion of
