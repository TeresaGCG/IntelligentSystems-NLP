with intercellular spaces. The innermost
layer of the cortex is called endodermis.
It comprises a single layer of barrel-shaped
cells without any intercellular spaces. The
tangential as well as radial walls of the
endodermal cells have a deposition of
water-impermeable, waxy material suberin
in the form of casparian strips. Next to
endodermis lies a few layers of thick-walled
parenchyomatous cells referred to as
pericycle. Initiation of lateral roots and
vascular cambium during the secondary
growth takes place in these cells. The pith
is small or inconspicuous. The
parenchymatous cells which lie between (a)
the xylem and the phloem are called
conjuctive tissue. There are usually two . .
to four xylem and phloem patches. Later, , ' '7 ' V _ “ ' Epidermis
a cambium ring develops between the ’
xylem and phloem. All tissues on the
innerside of the endodermis such as
pericycle, vascular bundles and pith
constitute the stele.

6.3.2 Monocotyledonous Root Protoxylem

The anatomy of the monocot root is similar
to the dicot root in many respects (Figure _
6.6 b). It has epidermis, cortex, endodermis, ' _ . etaxylem
pericycle, vascular bundles and pith. As ‘ ‘
compared to the dicot root which have fewer [b]

xylem bundles, there are usually more than Figure 6.6 TS. : (a) Dicot root (Primary)

root. Pith is large and well developed.

Monocotyledonous roots do not undergo
any secondary growth.

The transverse section of a typical young
dicotyledonous stem shows that the epidermis
is the outermost protective layer of the stem
