LOCOMOT ION AND MOVEMENT

 

20.3 SKELETAL SYSTEM

Skeletal system consists of a framework of bones and a few cartilages.
This system has a signiﬁcant role in movement shown by the body.
Imagine chewing food without jaw bones and walking around without
the limb bones. Bone and cartilage are specialised connective tissues.
The former has a very hard matrix due to calcium salts in it and the latter
has slightly pliable matrix due to chondroitin salts. In human beings,
this system is made up of 206 bones and a few cartilages. It is grouped
into two principal divisions — the axial and the appendicular skeleton.
Axial skeleton comprises 80 bones distributed along the main axis
of the body. The skull, vertebral column, sternum and ribs constitute
axial skeleton. The skull (Figure 20.6) is composed of two sets of bones —

cranial and facial, that totals to 22 bones. Cranial bones are 8 in number.
They form the hard protective outer covering, cranium for the brain. The
facial region is made up of 14 skeletal elements which form the front part
of the skull. A single U-shaped bone called hyoid is present at the base of
the buccal cavity and it is also included in the skull. Each middle ear
contains three tiny bones — Malleus, Incus and Stapes, collectively called
Ear Ossicles. The skull region articulates with the superior region of the
