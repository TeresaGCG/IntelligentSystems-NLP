Members of the Kingdom Fungi and simple plants such as algae
reproduce through special asexual reproductive structures (Figure 1.3).
The most common of these structures are zoospores that usually are
microscopic motile structures. Other common asexual reproductive
structures are conidia (Penicillium), buds (Hydra) and gemmules (sponge).

You have learnt about vegetative reproduction in plants in Class XI.
What do you think — Is vegetative reproduction also a type of asexual
reproduction? Why do you say so? Is the term clone applicable to the
offspring formed by vegetative reproduction?

While in animals and other simple organisms the term asexual is used
unambiguously, in plants, the term vegetative reproduction is frequently
used. In plants, the units of vegetative propagation such as runner,
rhizome, sucker, tuber, offset, bulb are all capable of giving rise to new

offspring (Figure 1.4). These structures are called vegetative propagules.
