Figure 1.2 Herbarium showing stored specimens

according to a universally accepted system of classification. These
specimens, along with their descriptions on herbarium sheets, become a
store house or repository for future use (Figure 1.2). The herbarium sheets
also carry a label providing information about date and place of collection,
English, local and botanical names, family, collector’s name, etc. Herbaria
also serve as quick referral systems in taxonomical studies.

1 .4.2 Botanical Gardens

These specialised gardens have collections of living plants for reference.
Plant species in these gardens are grown for identiﬁcation purposes and
each plant is labelled indicating its botanical / scientiﬁc name and its family.
The famous botanical gardens are at Kew (England), Indian Botanical
Garden, Howrah (India) and at National Botanical Research Institute,
Lucknow (India).

1.4.3 Museum

Biological museums are generally set up in educational institutes such
as schools and colleges. Museums have collections of preserved plant
and animal specimens for study and reference. Specimens are preserved
in the containers or jars in preservative solutions. Plant and animal
specimens may also be preserved as dry specimens. Insects are preserved
in insect boxes after collecting, killing and pinning. Larger animals like
birds and mammals are usually stuffed and preserved. Museums often
have collections of skeletons of animals too.
