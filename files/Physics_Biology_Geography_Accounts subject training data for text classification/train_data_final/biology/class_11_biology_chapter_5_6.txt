out photosynthesis. Underground stems of some plants such as grass
and strawberry, etc., spread to new niches and when older parts die new
plants are formed. In plants like mint and jasmine a slender lateral branch
arises from the base of the main axis and after growing aerially for some
time arch downwards to touch the ground. A lateral branch with short
internodes and each node bearing a rosette of leaves and a tuft of roots is
found in aquatic plants like Pistia and Eichhornia In banana, pineapple
and Chrysanthemum, the lateral branches originate from the basal and
underground portion of the main stem, grow horizontally beneath the
soil and then come out obliquely upward giving rise to leafy shoots.

5.3 THE LEAF

The leaf is a lateral, generally ﬂattened structure borne on the stem. It
develops at the node and bears a bud in its axil. The axillary bud later
develops into a branch. Leaves originate from shoot apical meristems and
are arranged in an acropetal order. They are the most important vegetative
organs for photosynthesis.

A typical leaf consists of three main parts: leaf base, petiole and lamina
(Figure 5.7 a). The leaf is attached to the stem by the leaf base and may
