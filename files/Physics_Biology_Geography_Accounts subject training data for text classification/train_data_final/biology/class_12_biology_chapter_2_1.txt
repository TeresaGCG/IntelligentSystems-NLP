homes and in gardens. Find out the names of ﬁve more ﬂowers that are
used in social and cultural celebrations in your family. Have you heard
of ﬂoriculture — what does it refer to?

To a biologist, ﬂowers are morphological and embryological marvels
and the sites of sexual reproduction. In class XI, you have read the various
parts of a ﬂower. Figure 2.1 will help you recall the parts of a typical
ﬂower. Can you name the two parts in a ﬂower in which the two most
important units of sexual reproduction develop?

2.2 PRE-FERTILISATION: STRUCTURES AND EVENTS

Much before the actual ﬂower is seen on a plant, the decision that the plant
is going to ﬂower has taken place. Several hormonal and structural changes
are initiated which lead to the differentiation and further development of
the ﬂoral primordium. Inﬂorescences are formed which bear the ﬂoral buds
and then the ﬂowers. In the ﬂower the male and female reproductive
structures, the androecium and the gynoecium differentiate and develop.
You would recollect that the androecium consists of a whorl of stamens
representing the male reproductive organ and the gynoecium represents
the female reproductive organ.
