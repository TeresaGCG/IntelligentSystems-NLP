The smooth muscle ﬁbres taper at both ends (fusiform) and do not
show striations (Figure 7.7b). Cell junctions hold them together and they
are bundled together in a connective tissue sheath. The wall of internal
organs such as the blood vessels, stomach and intestine contains this type
of muscle tissue. Smooth muscles are ‘involuntary’ as their functioning
cannot be directly controlled. We usually are not able to make it contract
merely by thinking about it as we can do with skeletal muscles.

Cardiac muscle tissue is a contractile tissue present only in the heart.
Cell junctions fuse the plasma membranes of cardiac muscle cells and
make them stick together (Figure 7.70). Communication junctions
(intercalated discs) at some fusion points allow the cells to contract as a
unit, i.e., when one cell receives a signal to contract, its neighbours are
also stimulated to contract.

7. 1 .4 Neural Tissue

Neural tissue exerts the greatest control over
the body’s responsiveness to changing
conditions. Neurons, the unit of neural Cell
system are excitable cells (Figure 7.8). The bOdY

neuroglial cell which constitute the rest of nxglls
the neural system protect and support

neurons. Neuroglia make up more than one-
half the volume of neural tissue in our body.
