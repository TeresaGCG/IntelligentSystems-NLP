BODY FLUIDS AND CIRCULATION

You have learnt that all living cells have to be provided With nutrients, O2
and other essential substances. Also, the waste or harmful substances
produced, have to be removed continuously for healthy functioning of
tissues. It is therefore, essential to have efficient mechanisms for the
movement of these substances to the cells and from the cells. Different
groups of animals have evolved different methods for this transport. Simple
organisms like sponges and coelenterates circulate water from their
surroundings through their body cavities to facilitate the cells to exchange
these substances. More complex organisms use special ﬂuids Within their
bodies to transport such materials. Blood is the most commonly used body
ﬂuid by most of the higher organisms including humans for this purpose.
Another body ﬂuid, lymph, also helps in the transport of certain substances.
In this chapter, you Will learn about the composition and properties of
blood and lymph (tissue ﬂuid) and the mechanism of circulation of blood
is also explained herein.

18. l BLOOD

Blood is a special connective tissue consisting of a ﬂuid matrix, plasma,
and formed elements.

18. 1. 1 Plasma

Plasma is a straw coloured, viscous ﬂuid constituting nearly 55 per cent of
the blood. 90-92 per cent of plasma is water and proteins contribute 6-8
per cent of it. Fibrinogen, globulins and albumins are the major proteins.
