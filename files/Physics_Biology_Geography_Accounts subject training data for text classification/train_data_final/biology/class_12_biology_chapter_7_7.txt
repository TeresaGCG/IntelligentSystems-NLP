varieties of ﬁnches in the same island. All the varieties, he conjectured,
evolved on the island itself. From the original seed-eating features, many
other forms with altered beaks arose, enabling them to become insectivorous
and vegetarian ﬁnches (Figure 7 .5). This process of evolution of different
species in a given geographical area starting from a point and literally
radiating to other areas of geography (habitats) is called adaptive radiation.
Darwin’s ﬁnches represent one of the best examples of this phenomenon.
Another example is Australian marsupials. A number of marsupials, each
different from the other Wigure 7 .6) evolved from an ancestral stock, but all
within the Australian island continent. When more than one adaptive radiation
appeared to have occurred in an isolated geographical area (representing
