The excretory organs occur as segmentally
arranged coiled tubules called nephridia
(sing.: nephridium). They are of three types:
(i) septal nephridia, present on both the sides of
intersegmental septa of segment 15 to the last

segment 3 to the last that open on the body
surface and (iii) pharyngeal nephridia, present
TUfts “f as three paired tufts in the 4th, 5th and 6th
segments (Figure 7 . 12). These different types of
nephridia are basically similar in structure.
Nephridia regulate the volume and composition
Integumentary of the body ﬂuids. A nephridium starts out as a
naphridia funnel that collects excess ﬂuid from coelomic
chamber. The funnel connects with a tubular part
Forests of of the nephridium which delivers the wastes
inl-eglll‘llem'dry through a pore to the surface in the body wall
nephridia into the digestive tube.
56PM] Nervous system is basically represented by
“Ephﬁdia ganglia arranged segmentwise on the ventral
paired nerve cord. The nerve cord in the anterior
region (3rd and 4th segments) bifurcates, laterally
encircling the pharynx and joins the cerebral
ganglia dorsally to form a nerve ring. The cerebral
ganglia alongwith other nerves in the ring
integrate sensory input as well as command
muscular responses of the body.
