Plasmolysed

 

Figure 11.5 Plant cell plasmolysis

the cell (or tissue) is placed in a solution that is hypertonic (has more solutes)
to the protoplasm. Water moves out; it is ﬁrst lost from the cytoplasm and
then from the vacuole. The water when drawn out of the cell through
diffusion into the extracellular (outside cell) ﬂuid causes the protoplast to
shrink away from the walls. The cell is said to be plasmolysed. The movement
of water occurred across the membrane moving from an area of high water
potential (i.e., the cell) to an area of lower water potential outside the cell
(Figure 1 1.5).

What occupies the space between the cell wall and the shrunken
protoplast in the plasmolysed cell?

When the cell (or tissue) is placed in an isotonic solution, there is no
net ﬂow of water towards the inside or outside. If the external solution
balances the osmotic pressure of the cytoplasm it is said to be isotonic.
When water ﬂows into the cell and out of the cell and are in equilibrium,
the cells are said to be ﬂaccid.

The process of plasmolysis is usually reversible. When the cells are
placed in a hypotonic solution (higher water potential or dilute solution
as compared to the cytoplasm), water diffuses into the cell causing the
cytoplasm to build up a pressure against the wall, that is called turgor
pressure. The pressure exerted by the protoplasts due to entry of water
against the rigid walls is called pressure potential ‘Pp. Because of the
rigidity of the cell wall, the cell does not rupture. This turgor pressure is
ultimately responsible for enlargement and extension growth of cells.

What would be the WP of a flaccid cell? Which organisms other than
plants possess cell wall ?

Imbibition is a special type of diffusion when water is absorbed by
solids — colloids — causing them to increase in volume. The classical
