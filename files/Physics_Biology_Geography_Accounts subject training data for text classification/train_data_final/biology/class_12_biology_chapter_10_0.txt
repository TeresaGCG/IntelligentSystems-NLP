where no other life-form could possibly exist— sites such
1 0'6 Microbes as Biofertilisers as deep inside the geysers (thermal vents) where the
temperature may be as high as 100°C, deep in the soil,
under the layers of snow several metres thick, and in highly
acidic environments. Microbes are diverse—protozoa,
bacteria, fungi and microscopic animal and plant viruses,
viroids and also prions that are proteinacious infectious
agents. Some of the microbes are shown in Figures 10.1
and 10.2.
Microbes like bacteria and many fungi can be grown
on nutritive media to form colonies Wigure 10.3), that can
be seen with the naked eyes. Such cultures are useful in

studies on micro-organisms.
