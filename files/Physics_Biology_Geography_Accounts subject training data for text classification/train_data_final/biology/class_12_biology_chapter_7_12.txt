Figure 7.9 A sketch of the evolution of plant forms through geological periods

could have been similar to the light reaction in photosynthesis where water
is split with the help of solar energy captured and channelised by
appropriate light harvesting pigments. Slowly single-celled organisms
became multi—cellular life forms. By the time of 500 mya. invertebrates
were formed and active. Jawless ﬁsh probably evolved around 350 mya.
Sea weeds and few plants existed probably around 320 mya. We are told
that the ﬁrst organisms that invaded land were plants. They were
widespread on land when animals invaded land. Fish with stout and strong
ﬁns could move on land and go back to water. This was about 350 mya. In
1938, a ﬁsh caught in South Africa happened to be a Coelacanth which was
thought to be extinct. These animals called lobeﬁns evolved into the
