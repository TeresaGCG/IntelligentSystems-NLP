7.7 HARDY-WEINBERG PRINCIPLE

In a given population one can find out the frequency of occurrence of
alleles of a gene or a locus. This frequency is supposed to remain ﬁxed
and even remain the same through generations. Hardy-Weinberg principle
stated it using algebraic equations.

This principle says that allele frequencies in a population are stable
and is constant from generation to generation. The gene pool (total genes
and their alleles in a population) remains a constant. This is called
genetic equilibrium. Sum total of all the allelic frequencies is 1. Individual
