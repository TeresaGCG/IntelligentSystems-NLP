BIOLOGY

Why is mitosis called equational division?

Name the stage of cell cycle at which one of the following events occur:
(i) Chromosomes are moved to spindle equator.

(ii) Centromere splits and chromatids separate.

(iii) Pairing between homologous chromosomes takes place.

(iv) Crossing over between homologous chromosomes takes place.

Describe the following:

(a) synapsis (b) bivalent (c) chiasmata

Draw a diagram to illustrate your answer.

How does cytokinesis in plant cells differ from that in animal cells?

Find examples where the four daughter cells from meiosis are equal in size and
where they are found unequal in size.

Distinguish anaphase of mitosis from anaphase I of meiosis.
List the main differences between mitosis and meiosis.
What is the signiﬁcance of meiosis?
Discuss with your teacher about
(i) haploid insects and lower plants where cell-division occurs, and
(ii) some haploid cells in higher plants where cell-division does not occur.
Can there be mitosis without DNA replication in ‘S’ phase?
Can there be DNA replication without cell division?

Analyse the events during every stage of cell cycle and notice how the following
two parameters change

(i) number of chromosomes (N) per cell

(ii) amount of DNA content (C) per cell
