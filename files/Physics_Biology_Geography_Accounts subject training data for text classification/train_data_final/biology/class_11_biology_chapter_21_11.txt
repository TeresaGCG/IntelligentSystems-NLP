within cochlea called scala media is ﬁlled with endolymph. At the base of
the cochlea, the scala vestibuli ends at the oval window, while the scala
tympani terminates at the round window which opens to the middle ear.

The organ of corti is a structure located on the basilar membrane
which contains hair cells that act as auditory receptors. The hair cells
are present in rows on the internal side of the organ of corti. The basal
end of the hair cell is in close contact with the afferent nerve ﬁbres. A large
number of processes called stereo cilia are projected from the apical part
of each hair cell. Above the rows of the hair cells is a thin elastic membrane
called tectorial membrane.

The inner ear also contains a complex system called vestibular
apparatus, located above the cochlea. The vestibular apparatus is
composed of three semi-circular canals and the otolith (macula is the
sensory part of saccule and utricle). Each semi-circular canal lies in a
different plane at right angles to each other. The membranous canals are
suspended in the perilymph of the bony canals. The base of canals is
