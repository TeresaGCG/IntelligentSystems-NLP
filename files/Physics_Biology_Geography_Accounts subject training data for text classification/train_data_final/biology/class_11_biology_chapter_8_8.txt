CELL: THE UNIT OF LIFE

Let us now look at individual cell organelles to understand their
structure and functions.

8.5. 1 Cell Membrane

The detailed structure of the membrane was studied only after the advent
of the electron microscope in the 1950s. Meanwhile, chemical studies on
the cell membrane, especially in human red blood cells (RBCs), enabled
the scientists to deduce the possible structure of plasma membrane.

These studies showed that the cell membrane is mainly composed of
lipids and proteins. The major lipids are phospholipids that are arranged
in a bilayer. Also, the lipids are arranged within the membrane with the
polar head towards the outer sides and the hydrophobic tails towards
the inner part.This ensures that the nonpolar tail of saturated
hydrocarbons is protected from the aqueous environment (Figure 8.4).
In addition to phospholipids membrane also contains cholesterol.

Later, biochemical investigation clearly revealed that the cell membranes
also possess protein and carbohydrate. The ratio of protein and lipid varies
considerably in different cell types. In human beings, the membrane of the
erythrocyte has approximately 52 per cent protein and 40 per cent lipids.

Depending on the ease of extraction, membrane proteins can be
classiÔ¨Åed as integral and peripheral. Peripheral proteins lie on the surface
of membrane while the integral proteins are partially or totally buried in
the membrane.
