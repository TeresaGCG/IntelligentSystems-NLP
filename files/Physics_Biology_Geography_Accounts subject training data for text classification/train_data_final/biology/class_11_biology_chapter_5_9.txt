Figure 5.12 Cymose inﬂorescence

BIOLOGY

ﬂoral axis is termed as inﬂorescence. Depending
on whether the apex gets developed into a ﬂower or
continues to grow, two major types of inﬂorescences
are deﬁned — racemose and cymose. In racemose
type of inﬂorescences the main axis continues to
grow, the ﬂowers are borne laterally in an acropetal
succession (Figure 5.1 1).

In cymose type of inﬂorescence the main axis
terminates in a ﬂower, hence is limited in growth.The
ﬂowers are borne in a basipetal order (Figure 5.12).

5.5 THE FLOWER

The ﬂower is the reproductive unit in the
angiosperms. It is meant for sexual reproduction.
A typical ﬂower has four different kinds of whorls
arranged successively on the swollen end of the
stalk or pedicel, called thalamus or receptacle.
These are calyx, corolla, androecium and
gynoecium. Calyx and corolla are accessory organs,
while androecium and gynoecium are reproductive
organs. In some ﬂowers like lily, the calyx and
corolla are not distinct and are termed as perianth.
When a ﬂower has both androecium and
gynoecium, it is bisexual. A ﬂower having either
only stamens or only carpels is unisexual.

In symmetry, the ﬂower may be
actinomorphic (radial symmetry) or
zygomorphic (bilateral symmetry). When a ﬂower
can be divided into two equal radial halves in any
radial plane passing through the centre, it is said
to be actinomorphic, e. g., mustard, datura, chilli.
When it can be divided into two similar halves only
in one particular vertical plane, it is zygomorphic,
e.g., pea, gulmohur, bean, Cassia. A ﬂower is

asymmetric (irregular) if it cannot be divided into
two similar halves by any vertical plane passing
through the centre, as in canna.

A ﬂower may be trimerous, tetramerous or
pentamerous when the ﬂoral appendages are in
multiple of 3, 4 or 5, respectively. Flowers
with bracts-reduced leaf found at the base of the
pedicel-are called bracteate and those without
bracts, ebracteate.
