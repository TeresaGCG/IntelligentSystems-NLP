DIGESTION AND ABSORPTION

Proteins, proteoses and peptones (partially hydrolysed proteins) in
the chyme reaching the intestine are acted upon by the proteolytic
enzymes of pancreatic juice as given below:

Proteins T ‘/Ch t .
sm 0 sm _ _
Peptones W) Dlpeptldes
Carboxypeptidase
Proteoses

Carbohydrates in the chyme are hydrolysed by pancreatic amylase
into disaccharides.

Polysaccharides (starch) ﬂ) Disaccharides

Fats are broken down by lipases With the help of bile into di-and
monoglycerides.

Fats Lipases

Diglycerides —> Monoglycerides
Nucleases in the pancreatic juice acts on nucleic acids to form
nucleotides and nucleosides

Nucleic acids M) Nucleotides —> Nucleosides

The enzymes in the succus entericus act on the end products of the
above reactions to form the respective simple absorbable forms. These
ﬁnal steps in digestion occur very close to the mucosal epithelial cells of
the intestine.

Dipeptidases

Dipeptides Amino acids

Maltose MGlucose + Glucose

Lactose ﬂ) Glucose + Galactose

Sucrose ﬂ) G1ucose+ Fructose

Nucleotides m Nucleosides w) Sugars + Bases

Di and Monoglycerides ﬂ Fatty acids + Glycerol

The breakdown of biomacromolecules mentioned above occurs in the
duodenum region of the small intestine. The simple substances thus
formed are absorbed in the jejunum and ileum regions of the small
intestine. The undigested and unabsorbed substances are passed on to
the large intestine.
