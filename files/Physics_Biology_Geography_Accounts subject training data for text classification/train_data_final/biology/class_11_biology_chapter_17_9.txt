EXERCISES

Deﬁne vital capacity. What is its signiﬁcance?
State the volume of air remaining in the lungs after a normal breathing.

Diffusion of gases occurs in the alveolar region only and not in the other parts of
respiratory system. Why?

What are the major transport mechanisms for 002? Explain.

What will be the p02 and p002 in the atmospheric air compared to those in the
alveolar air ?

(i) pO2 lesser, pCO2 higher

(ii) pO2 higher, pCO2 lesser

(iii) pO2 higher, pCO2 higher

(iv) pO2 lesser, pCO2 lesser

Explain the process of inspiration under normal conditions.

How is respiration regulated?

What is the effect of p002 on oxygen transport?

What happens to the respiratory process in a man going up a hill?
What is the site of gaseous exchange in an insect?

Deﬁne oxygen dissociation curve. Can you suggest any reason for its sigmoidal
pattern?

Have you heard about hypoxia? Try to gather information about it, and discuss
with your friends.

Distinguish between

(a) IRV and ERV

(b) Inspiratory capacity and Expiratory capacity.
(c) Vital capacity and Total lung capacity.

What is Tidal volume? Find out the Tidal volume (approximate value) for a healthy
human in an hour.
