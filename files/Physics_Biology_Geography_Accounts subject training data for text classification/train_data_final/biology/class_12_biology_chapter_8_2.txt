HUMAN HEALTH AND DISEASE

 

Health, for a long time, was considered as a state of body
and mind where there was a balance of certain ‘humors’.
This is what early Greeks like Hippocrates as well as
Indian Ayurveda system of medicine asserted. It was
thought that persons with ‘blackbile’ belonged to hot
personality and would have fevers. This idea was arrived
at by pure reﬂective thought. The discovery of blood
circulation by William Harvey using experimental method
and the demonstration of normal body temperature in
persons with blackbile using thermometer disproved the
‘good humor’ hypothesis of health. In later years, biology
stated that mind inﬂuences, through neural system and
endocrine system, our immune system and that our
immune system maintains our health. Hence, mind and
mental state can affect our health. Of course, health is
affected by —

(i) genetic disorders — deﬁciencies with which a child is
born and deﬁciencies / defects which the child inherits
from parents from birth;

(ii) infections and
(iii) life style including food and water we take, rest and
exercise we give to our bodies, habits that we have or
lack etc.
