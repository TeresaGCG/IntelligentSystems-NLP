MORPHOLOGY OF FLOWERING PLANTS 7 1

In palmately compound leaves, the
leaﬂets are attached at a common point, i.e.,
at the tip of petiole, as in silk cotton.

5.3.3 Phyllotaxy

 

Phyllotaxy is the pattern of arrangement of
leaves on the stem or branch. This is usually
of three types — alternate, opposite and
whorled (Figure 5.9). In alternate type of
phyllotaxy, a single leaf arises at each node
in alternate manner, as in china rose,
mustard and sun ﬂower plants. In opposite
type, a pair of leaves arise at each node and
lie opposite to each other as in Calotropis
and guava plants. If more than two leaves
arise at a node and form a whorl, it is called

functions other than photosynthesis. They
are converted into tendrils for climbing as
in peas or into spines for defence as in cacti
(Figure 5.10 a, b). The ﬂeshy leaves of onion
and garlic store food (Figure 5.100). In some
plants such as Australian acacia, the leaves
are small and short-lived. The petioles in
these plants expand, become green and
synthesise food. Leaves of certain
insectivorous plants such as pitcher plant,
venus-ﬂy trap are also modiﬁed leaves.

5.4 THE INFLORESCENCE

A ﬂower is a modiﬁed shoot wherein the shoot
apical meristem changes to ﬂoral meristem.
Internodes do not elongate and the axis gets
condensed. The apex produces different Fleshy
kinds of ﬂoral appendages laterally at leaves
