RESPIRATION IN PLANTS

All of us breathe to live, but why is breathing so essential to life? What
happens when we breathe? Also, do all living organisms, including plants
and microbes, breathe? If so, how?

All living organisms need energy for carrying out daily life activities,
be it absorption, transport, movement, reproduction or even breathing.
Where does all this energy come from? We know we eat food for energy —
but how is this energy taken from food? How is this energy utilised? Do
all foods give the same amount of energy? Do plants ‘eat’? Where do plants
get their energy from? And micro-organisms — for their energy
requirements, do they eat ‘food’?

You may wonder at the several questions raised above — they may
seem to be very disconnected. But in reality, the process of breathing is
very much connected to the process of release of energy from food. Let us
try and understand how this happens.

All the energy required for ‘life’ processes is obtained by oxidation of
some macromolecules that we call ‘food’. Only green plants and
cyanobacteria can prepare their own food; by the process of photosynthesis
they trap light energy and convert it into chemical energy that is stored in
the bonds of carbohydrates like glucose, sucrose and starch. We must
remember that in green plants too, not all cells, tissues and organs
photosynthesise; only cells containing chloroplasts, that are most often
located in the superﬁcial layers, carry out photosynthesis. Hence, even
in green plants all other organs, tissues and cells that are non-green,
need food for oxidation. Hence, food has to be translocated to all non-
green parts. Animals are heterotrophic, i.e., they obtain food from plants
