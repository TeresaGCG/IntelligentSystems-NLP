5.2 THE STEM

What are the features that distinguish a stem from a root? The stem is the
ascending part of the axis bearing branches, leaves, ﬂowers and fruits. It
develops from the plumule of the embryo of a germinating seed. The stem
bears nodes and internodes. The region of the stem where leaves are
born are called nodes while internodes are the portions between two nodes.
The stem bears buds, which may be terminal or axillary. Stem is generally
green when young and later often become woody and dark brown.

The main function of the stem is spreading out branches bearing
leaves, ﬂowers and fruits. It conducts water, minerals and photosynthates.
Some stems perform the function of storage of food, support, protection
and of vegetative propagation.

5.2.1 Modiﬁcations of Stem

The stem may not always be typically like what they are expected to be.
They are modiﬁed to perform different functions (Figure 5.6). Underground
stems of potato, ginger, turmeric, zaminkand, Colocasia are modiﬁed to
store food in them. They also act as organs of perennation to tide over
conditions unfavourable for growth. Stem tendrils which develop from
axillary buds, are slender and spirally coiled and help plants to climb
such as in gourds (cucumber, pumpkins, watermelon) and grapevines.
Axillary buds of stems may also get modiﬁed into woody, straight and
pointed thorns. Thorns are found in many plants such as Citrus,
Bougainvillea. They protect plants from browsing animals. Some plants
of arid regions modify their stems into ﬂattened (Opuntia), or ﬂeshy
cylindrical (Euphorbia) structures. They contain chlorophyll and carry
