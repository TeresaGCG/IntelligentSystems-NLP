Such similarities can be interpreted to understand Whether common
ancestors were shared or not. For example Whales, bats, Cheetah and
human (all mammals) share similarities in the pattern of bones of forelimbs
I 3 0 Wigure 7 .3b). Though these forelimbs perform different functions in these
animals, they have similar anatomical structure — all of them have
humerus, radius, ulna, carpals, metacarpals and phalanges in their
forelimbs. Hence, in these animals, the same structure developed along
different directions due to adaptations to different needs. This is divergent
evolution and these structures are homologous. Homology indicates
common ancestry. Other examples are vertebrate hearts or brains. In
