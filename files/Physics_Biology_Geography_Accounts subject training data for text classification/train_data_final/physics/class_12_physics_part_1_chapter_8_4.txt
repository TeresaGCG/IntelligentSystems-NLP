a consequence of the displacement current being a source of a magnetic
field. Thus, time- dependent electric and magnetic ﬁelds give rise to each
other! Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction and Ampere-Maxwell
law give a quantitative expression of this statement, with the current
being the total current, as in Eq. (8.5). One very important consequence
of this symmetry is the existence of electromagnetic waves, which we
discuss qualitatively in the next section.

Example 8.1 A parallel plate capacitor with circular plates of radius
1 m has a capacitance of l nF. At t = 0, it is connected for charging in
series with a resistor R = 1 M9 across a 2V battery (Fig. 8.3). Calculate
the magnetic field at a point P, halfway between the centre and the
periphery of the plates, after t = 10‘3 s. (The charge on the capacitor
at time t is q (t) = CV [l — exp (—t/r)], where the time constant T is
equal to CR.)

Solution The time constant of the CR circuit is I = CR = 10‘3 s. Then,
we have
