to 103 m s‘1 so that it can have a high
probability of interacting with isotope 2SSU
and causing it to fission. Show that a
neutron can lose most of its kinetic energy
in an elastic collision with a light nuclei
like deuten‘um or carbon which has a mass
of only a few times the neutron mass. The
material making up the light nuclei. usually
heavy water (D20) or graphite. is called a
moderator.

 

Answer The initial kinetic energy of the neutron
is

1
Kli = E m1v12i

while its final kinetic energy from Eq. (6.27)

2
1 2 1 m1_m2 2
KleEmlvlf 2—m1{m +m vli
1 2

The fractional kinetic energy lost is
2
f 2 Km 2 w
1 Kli m1 + m2

while the fractional kinetic energy gained by the
moderating nuclei KZf / K h. is

 

f2 = 1 — f1 (elastic collision)

4mlm2

(m1 + m2 )2

One can also verify this result by substituting
from Eq. (6.28).

For deuterium m2 = 2m1 and we obtain
f1 = 1/9 whilef2 = 8/9. Almost 90% of the
neutron’s energy is transferred to deuterium. For
carbon j"1 = 71.6% and f2 = 28.4%. In practice,
however, this number is smaller since head-on
collisions are rare. 4

If the initial velocities and final velocities of
both the bodies are along the same straight line,
then it is called a one-dimensional collision, or
head-on collision. In the case of small spherical
bodies, this is possible if the direction of travel
of body 1 passes through the centre of body 2
which is at rest. In general, the collision is two-
dimensional, where the initial velocities and the
final velocities lie in a plane.

6. 12.3 Collisions in Two Dimensions

Fig. 6.10 also depicts the collision of a moving
mass m1 with the stationary mass m2. Linear
momentum is conserved in such a collision.
Since momentum is a vector this implies three
equations for the three directions (x, y, 2}.
Consider the plane determined by the final
velocity directions of m1 and m2 and choose it to
be the x—y plane. The conservation of the
z-component of the linear momentum implies
that the entire collision is in the x—y plane. The
x— and y-component equations are

”11%: mlvlfcos 01 + mgvycos 02 (6.29)

O = mlv sin 61 — n12v2f sin 62 (6.30)

1f
One lmows {m1, m2, v1 3 in most situations. There
are thus four unknowns {v1f, vgf, 01 and 02}, and
only two equations. If 6 1 = 6 2 = O, we regain
Eq. (6.24) for one dimensional collision.

If, further the collision is elastic,

lmv.2=lmv 2+1 v 2 (631)
2 1 11 2 1 1f 2 m2 2f -

We obtain an additional equation. That still
leaves us one equation short. At least one of
the four unknowns, say 0 1, must be made known
for the problem to be solvable. For example, 01
can be determined by moving a detector in an
angular fashion from the x to the y axis. Given
(ml, m2, v”, 01} we can determine {1) 02}

1f’ v2f’
from Eqs. (6.29)-(6.3 l).

   

F Example 6.13 Consider the collision
depicted in Fig. 6.10 to be between two
billiard balls with equal masses ml = m2.
The first ball is called the cue while the
second ball is called the target. The
billiard player wants to ‘sink‘ the target
ball in a corner pocket, which is at an
angle 62 = 37°. Assume that the collision
is elastic and that friction and rotational
motion are not important. Obtain 91.

 

 

 

Answer From momentum conservation, since
the masses are equal

V11 = vlf + V2f

or ”1i2=("1f +V2f)'(v1f +V2f)

2 2
=v1f +v2f +2v1f.v2f
