4.25 A circular coil of 20 turns and radius 10 cm is placed in a uniform
magnetic field of 0.10 T normal to the plane of the coil. If the current
in the coil is 5.0 A, what is the
(a) total torque on the coil,

(b) total force on the coil,

(c) average force on each electron in the coil due to the magnetic
field?

(The coil is made of copper wire of cross-sectional area 10’5 m2, and

the free electron density in copper is given to be about

1029 m‘s.)

4.26 A solenoid 60 cm long and of radius 4.0 cm has 3 layers of windings
of 300 turns each. A 2.0 cm long wire of mass 25 g lies inside the
solenoid (near its centre) normal to its axis; both the wire and the
axis of the solenoid are in the horizontal plane. The wire is connected
through two leads parallel to the axis of the solenoid to an external
battery which supplies a current of 6.0 A in the wire. What value of
current (with appropriate sense of circulation) in the windings of
the solenoid can support the weight of the wire? 9 = 9.8 m s22.

4.27 A galvanometer coil has a resistance of 12 Q and the metre shows
full scale deﬂection for a current of 3 mA. How will you convert the
metre into a voltmeter of range 0 to 18 V?

4.28 A galvanometer coil has a resistance of 15 Q and the metre shows
full scale deﬂection for a current of 4 mA. How will you convert the
metre into an ammeter of range 0 to 6 A?
