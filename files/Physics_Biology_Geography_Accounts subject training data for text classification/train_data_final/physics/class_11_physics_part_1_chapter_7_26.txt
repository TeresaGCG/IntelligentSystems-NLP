7. 10. 1 Theorem of parallel axes

This theorem is applicable to a body of any
shape. It allows to find the moment of inertia of
a body about any axis, given the moment of
inertia of the body about a parallel axis through
the centre of mass of the body. We shall only
state this theorem and not give its proof. We
shall, however, apply it to a few simple situations
which will be enough to convince us about the
usefulness of the theorem. The theorem may
be stated as follows:

The moment of inertia of a body about any
axis is equal to the sum of the moment of
inertia of the body about a parallel axis passing
through its centre of mass and the product of
its mass and the square of the distance
between the two parallel axes. As shown in
the Fig. 7.31, z and z’ are two parallel axes,
separated by a distance a. The z-axis passes
through the centre of mass 0 of the rigid body.
Then according to the theorem of parallel axes

IZ,=IZ+ Ma2 (7.37)
where 12 and I2, are the moments of inertia of the
body about the z and z’axes respectively, M is the
total mass of the body and a is the perpendicular
distance between the two parallel axes.

> Example 7.11 What is the moment of
inertia of a rod of mass M. length I about

an axis perpendicular to it through one
end?

 

Answer For the rod of mass M and length l,
I = Ml2/12. Using the parallel axes theorem,
I’= I+ Ma2 with a= 1/2 we get,

2 2 2
I’=Ml—+M(L) = M
12 2 3

We can check this independently since I is
half the moment of inertia of a rod of mass 2M
and length 21 about its midpoint,

412 1 M12

I’=2M.—><—=
12 2 3

 

 

FExample 7.12 What is the moment of

inertia of a ring about a tangent to the
circle of the ring?

 

Answer
The tangent to the ring in the plane of the ring
is parallel to one of the diameters of the ring.

The distance between these two parallel axes is
R, the radius of the ring. Using the parallel axes
theorem,

7. 1 1 KINEMATICS OF ROTATIONAL MOTION
ABOUT A FIXED AXIS

We have already indicated the analogy between
rotational motion and translational motion. For
example, the angular velocity 0) plays the same
role in rotation as the linear velocity v in
translation. We wish to take this analogy
further. In doing so we shall restrict the
discussion only to rotation about fixed axis. This
case of motion involves only one degree of
freedom, i.e., needs only one independent
variable to describe the motion. This in
translation corresponds to linear motion. This
section is limited only to kinematics. We shall
turn to dynamics in later sections.

We recall that for specifying the angular
displacement of the rotating body we take any
particle like P (Fig.7 .33) of the body. Its angular
displacement 6 in the plane it moves is the
angular displacement of the whole body; 0 is
measured from a fixed direction in the plane of

motion of P, which we take to be the x’-axis,
chosen parallel to the x-axis. Note, as shown,
the axis of rotation is the z — axis and the plane
of the motion of the particle is the x - y plane.
Fig. 7.33 also shows 00, the angular
displacement at t= 0.

We also recall that the angular velocity is
the time rate of change of angular displacement,
a) = dO/dt. Note since the axis of rotation is fixed,
