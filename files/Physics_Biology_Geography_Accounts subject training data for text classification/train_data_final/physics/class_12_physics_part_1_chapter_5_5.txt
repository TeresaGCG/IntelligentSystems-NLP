EXAMPLE 5. 1

In magnitude 1 = mB sin0
Here 1: is restoring torque and 6 is the angle between m and B.
2
Therefore, in equilibrium 5] fit? : — mB sin 6?
Negative sign with mB sine implies that restoring torque is in opposition

to deﬂecting torque. For small values of 6 in radians, we approximate
sin 0x6 and get

This represents a simple harmonic motion. The square of the angular
frequency is (o2 = mB/ﬂ and the time period is,

An expression for magnetic potential energy can also be obtained on
lines similar to electrostatic potential energy.
The magnetic potential energy Um is given by

Um = j t(9)d0

= ImBsinGdH = —chos6

= —m.B (5-6)

We have emphasised in Chapter 2 that the zero of potential energy
can be ﬁxed at one’s convenience. Taking the constant of integration to be
zero means ﬁxing the zero of potential energy at 0 = 90°, i.e., when the
needle is perpendicular to the ﬁeld. Equation (5.6) shows that potential
energy is minimum (= —mB) at 0 = 0° (most stable position) and maximum
(= +mB) at 0 = 180° (most unstable position).

Example 5.1 In Fig. 5.4(b), the magnetic needle has magnetic moment
6.7 X 10‘2 Am2 and moment of inertia J = 7.5 X 10‘6 kg m2. It performs
10 complete oscillations in 6.70 s. What is the magnitude of the
magnetic field?

Solution The time period of oscillation is,

T = ﬂ = 0.675
