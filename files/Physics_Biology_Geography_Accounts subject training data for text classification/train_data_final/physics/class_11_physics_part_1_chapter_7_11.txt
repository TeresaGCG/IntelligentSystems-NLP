From this follow the results

(i) ixi=0, jxj=0, lixli=0
(ii) ix 3 = 1;
Note that the magnitude of ix} is sin900

or 1, since i and j both have unit
magnitude and the angle between them is 90°.

Thus, ix} is a unit vector. A unit vector

perpendicular to the plane of i and j and
related to them by the right hand screw rule is
1“. Hence, the above result. You may verify
similarly,
jxli=i and ﬁxi=j

From the rule for commutation of the cross
product, it follows:

Note if Lilioccur cyclically in the above
vector product relation, the vector product is

positive. If ii]; do not occur in cyclic order,

the vector product is negative.
Now,

a x b = (axi + ayj + azﬁ) >< (bxi + by} + bzli)

= axbyﬁ — axsz — aybxli + aybzi + azb 3— azbyi

We have used the elementary cross products
in obtaining the above relation. The expression

for aXb can be put in a determinant form
which is easy to remember.

7.6 ANGULAR VELOCITY AND ITS
RELATION WITH LINEAR VELOCITY

In this section we shall study what is angular
velocity and its role in rotational motion. We
have seen that every particle of a rotating body
moves in a circle. The linear velocity of the
particle is related to the angular velocity. The
relation between these two quantities involves
a vector product which we learnt about in the
last section.

Let us go back to Fig. 7 .4. As said above, in
rotational motion of a rigid body about a fixed
axis, every particle of the body moves in a circle,

of the rigid body rotating about the ﬁxed
(2-) axis moves in a circle with centre (C)
on the axis.)

which lies in a plane perpendicular to the axis
and has its centre on the axis. In Fig. 7.16 we
redraw Fig. 7 .4, showing a typical particle (at a
point P) of the rigid body rotating about a fixed
axis (taken as the z-axis). The particle describes
