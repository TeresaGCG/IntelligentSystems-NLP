The magnitude of the total ﬁeld is obtained by summing over all the
elements — in other words by integrating from x = — lto x = + 1. Thus,

dB:

 

Jtonla2 1 dx
B_ 2 I-l[(r—x)2+a2]3/2

This integration can be done by trigonometric substitutions. This
exercise, however, is not necessary for our purpose. Note that the range
of x is from — l to + I. Consider the far axial field of the solenoid, i.e.,
r >> a and r >> 1. Then the denominator is approximated by

[(r — x)2 + a213/2 z r3

Note that the magnitude of the magnetic moment of the solenoid is,
m = n (21) I (at a2) — (total number of turns X current >< cross-sectional
area). Thus,

This is also the far axial magnetic field of a bar magnet which one may
obtain experimentally. Thus, a bar magnet and a solenoid produce similar
magnetic fields. The magnetic moment of a bar magnet is thus equal to
the magnetic moment of an equivalent solenoid that produces the same
magnetic field.

Some textbooks assign a magnetic charge (also called pole strength)
+qmto the north pole and —qm to the south pole of a bar magnet of length
21, and magnetic moment qm(2l). The field strength due to qm at a distance
r from it is given by ,uoqm/4at r2. The magnetic field due to the bar magnet
is then obtained, both for the axial and the equatorial case, in a manner
analogous to that of an electric dipole (Chapter 1). The method is simple
and appealing. However, magnetic monopoles do not exist, and we have
avoided this approach for that reason.

5.2.3 The dipole in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld

The pattern of iron filings, i.e., the magnetic field lines gives us an
approximate idea of the magnetic field B. We may at times be required to
determine the magnitude of B accurately. This is done by placing a small
compass needle of known magnetic moment In and moment of inertia .4
and allowing it to oscillate in the magnetic field. This arrangement is shown
in Fig. 5.4(b).

The torque on the needle is [see Eq. (4.29)],
1' = m x B (5.3) 177
