Example 5.2 A short bar magnet placed with its axis at 30° with an
external field of 800 G experiences a torque of 0.016 Nm. (a) What is
the magnetic moment of the magnet? (b) What is the work done in
moving it from its most stable to most unstable position? (c) The bar
magnet is replaced by a solenoid of cross-sectional area 2 X 10‘4 m2
and 1000 turns, but of the same magnetic moment. Determine the
current ﬂowing through the solenoid.

Solution
(a) From Eq. (5.3),1: = m B sin 9, 9: 30°, hence sine =1/2.
Thus, 0.016 = m x (800 x 10‘4 T) x (1/2)

m = 160 X 2/800 = 0.40 A m2

(b) From Eq. (5.6), the most stable position is 0 = 0° and the most
unstable position is 9 = 180°. Work done is given by

W = Um(9= 180°)—Um(19= 0°)
= 2 mB= 2 x 0.40 x 800 x 104: 0.064J
(c) From Eq. (4.30), m5 = NIA. From part (a), mS = 0.40 A m2
0.40 = 1000 x Ix 2 x 10‘4
I = 0.40 x 104/(1000 x 2) = 2A

Example 5.3

(a) What happens if a bar magnet is cut into two pieces: (i) transverse
to its length, (ii) along its length?

(b) A magnetised needle in a uniform magnetic field experiences a
torque but no net force. An iron nail near a bar magnet, however,
experiences a force of attraction in addition to a torque. Why?

(c) Must every magnetic configuration have a north pole and a south
pole? What about the field due to a toroid?

((1) TWO identical looking iron bars A and B are given, one of which is
definitely known to be magnetised. (We do not know which one.)
How would one ascertain whether or not both are magnetised? If
only one is magnetised, how does one ascertain which one? [Use
nothing else but the bars A and B.]

Solution

(a) In either case, one gets two magnets, each with a north and south
pole.

(b) No force if the ﬁeld is uniform. The iron nail experiences a non-
uniform field due to the bar magnet. There is induced magnetic
moment in the nail, therefore, it experiences both force and torque.
The net force is attractive because the induced south pole (say) in
the nail is closer to the north pole of magnet than induced north
pole.

(c) Not necessarily. True only if the source of the field has a net non-
zero magnetic moment. This is not so for a toroid or even for a
straight infinite conductor.

((1) Try to bring different ends of the bars closer. A repulsive force in
some situation establishes that both are magnetised. If it is always
attractive, then one of them is not magnetised. In a bar magnet
the intensity of the magnetic field is the strongest at the two ends
(poles) and weakest at the central region. This fact may be used to
determine whether A or B is the magnet, In this case, to see which
