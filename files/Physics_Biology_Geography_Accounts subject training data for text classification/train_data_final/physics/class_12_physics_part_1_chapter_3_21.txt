If we wish to replace the combination by a single cell between A and
C of emf seq and internal resistance req, we would have

VAC = eeq— I req (3.63)
Comparing the last two equations, we get

seq = 81 + 82 (3.64)

and req = r1 + r2 (3.65)

In Fig.3.20, we had connected the negative electrode of the first to the
positive electrode of the second. If instead we connect the two negatives,
Eq. (3.6 1) would change to VBC = —£2—Ir2 and we will get

seq = 81 — 82 (81 > 82) (3.66)
The rule for series combination clearly can be extended to any number
of cells:

(i) The equivalent emf of a series combination of 11 cells is just the sum of
their individual emfs, and

(ii) The equivalent internal resistance of a series combination of 11 cells is
just the sum of their internal resistances.

This is so, when the current leaves each cell from the positive
electrode. If in the combination, the current leaves any cell from
the negative electrode, the emf of the cell enters the expression

1 C for egg with a negative sign, as in Eq. (3.66).

Next, consider a parallel combination of the cells (Fig. 3.2 1).
I1 and I2 are the currents leaving the positive electrodes of the
cells. At the point B1, I1 and I2 ﬂow in whereas the current I ﬂows
out. Since as much charge ﬂows in as out, we have

across A and C» the Then, considering the first cell, the potential difference across its
comblnatlon can be terminals is V(B1) — V(B2). Hence, from Eq. (3.57)

1395' (3'73) and (3'74)‘ cell. Hence considering the second cell, we also have
VEV(B1) —V(B2)= g2 — 12r2 (3.69)
