For metals, ais positive and values of a for some metals at T0 = 0°C are
listed in Table 3.1.

The relation of Eq. (3.26) implies that a graph of pT plotted against T
would be a straight line. At temperatures much lower than 0°C, the graph,
however, deviates considerably from a straight line (Fig. 3.9).

Equation (3.26) thus, can be used approximately over a limited range
of T around any reference temperature To, where the graph can be
approximated as a straight line.

p,,. of nichrome as a Temperature dependence
function of absolute of resistivity for a typical

Some materials like Nichrome (which is an alloy of nickel, iron and
chromium) exhibit a very weak dependence of resistivity with temperature
(Fig. 3.10). Manganin and constantan have similar properties. These
materials are thus widely used in wire bound standard resistors since
their resistance values would change very little with temperatures.

Unlike metals, the resistivities of semiconductors decrease with
increasing temperatures. A typical dependence is shown in Fig. 3.1 1.

We can qualitatively understand the temperature dependence of
resistivity, in the light of our derivation of Eq. (3.23). From this equation,
resistivity of a material is given by

p thus depends inversely both on the number n of free electrons per unit
volume and on the average time 1' between collisions. As we increase
temperature, average speed of the electrons, which act as the carriers of
current, increases resulting in more frequent collisions. The average time
of collisions I, thus decreases with temperature.

In a metal, n is not dependent on temperature to any appreciable

extent and thus the decrease in the value of T with rise in temperature
causes p to increase as we have observed.

For insulators and semiconductors, however, n increases with
temperature. This increase more than compensates any decrease in 1: in
Eq.(3.23) so that for such materials, p decreases with temperature.
