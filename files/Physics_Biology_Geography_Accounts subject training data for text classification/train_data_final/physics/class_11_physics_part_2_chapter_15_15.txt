PHYSICS

 

Normal modes of a circular membrane rigidly
clamped to the circumference as in a tabla are
determined by the boundary condition that no
point on the circumference of the membrane
vibrates. Estimation of the frequencies of normal
modes of this system is more complex. This
problem involves wave propagation in two
dimensions. However, the underlying physics is
the same.

Example 15.5 A pipe. 30.0 cm long. is
open at both ends. Which harmonic mode
of the pipe resonates a 1 . 1 kHz source? Will
resonance with the same source be

observed if one end of the pipe is closed ‘?
Take the speed of sound in air as
330 m s".

 

Answer The ﬁrst harmonic frequency is given
by
D D .
v1 = Tl=ﬁ (open pipe)

where L is the length of the pipe. The frequency
of its nth harmonic is:

vn= %, forn= 1, 2, 3, (open pipe)

First few modes of an open pipe are shown in
Fig. 15.15.

Clearly, a source of frequency 1.1 kHz will
resonate at v2, i.e. the second harmonic.

Now if one end of the pipe is closed (Fig. 1 5. 1 5),
it follows from Eq. (14.50) that the fundamental
frequency is

D D ,
v1 — leﬁ (pipe closed at one end)

For L = 30 cm and v = 330 m S'l, the
fundamental frequency of the pipe closed at one
end is 275 Hz and the source frequency
corresponds to its fourth harmonic. Since this
harmonic is not a possible mode, no resonance
will be observed with the source, the moment
one end is closed. 4
