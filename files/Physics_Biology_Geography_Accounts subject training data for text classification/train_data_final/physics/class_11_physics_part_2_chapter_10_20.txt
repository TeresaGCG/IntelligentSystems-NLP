> Example 10.1 1 The lower end of a capillary
tube of diameter 2.00 mm is dipped 8.00
cm below the surface of water in a beaker.
What is the pressure required in the tube
in order to blow a hemispherical bubble at
its end in water? The surface tension of

water at temperature of the experiments is
7.30><10'2 Nm‘l. l atmospheric pressure =
1.01 X 105 Pa. density ofwater = 1000 kg/m“.
g = 9.80 m s2. Also calculate the excess
pressure.

 

AnswerThe excess pressure in a bubble of gas
in a liquid is given by 28/ r, where S is the
surface tension of the liquid-gas interface. You
should note there is only one liquid surface in
this case. (For a bubble of liquid in a gas, there
are two liquid surfaces, so the formula for

excess pressure in that case is 4S/r.) The
radius of the bubble is r. Now the pressure
outside the bubble P0 equals atmospheric
pressure plus the pressure due to 8.00 cm of
water column. That is

P0 = (1.01 X 105 Pa + 0.08 m X 1000 kg m‘3

X 9.80 m S'Z)
= 1.01784 X 105 Pa
Therefore, the pressure inside the bubble is
Pi = P0 + ZS/r

= 1.01784X 105 Pa+ (2 X 7.3 X 10'2 Pa m/ 10'3 m)

= (1.01784 + 0.00146) X 105 Pa

= 1.02 X 105 Pa
where the radius of the bubble is taken
to be equal to the radius of the capillary tube,
since the bubble is hemispherical ! (The answer
has been rounded off to three significant

figures.) The excess pressure in the
bubble is 146 Pa. 4

SUMNIARY

1. The basic property of a ﬂuid is that it can ﬂow. The ﬂuid does not have any
resistance to change of its shape. Thus, the shape of a ﬂuid is governed by the

shape of its container.

2. A liquid is incompressible and has a free surface of its own. A gas is compressible
and it expands to occupy all the space available to it.

3. If F is the normal force exerted by a ﬂuid on an area A then the average pressure Pav
is defined as the ratio of the force to area

P..=—
A

4. The unit of the pressure is the pascal (Pa). It is the same as N m’z. Other common

units of pressure are

1 atm = 1.01X105 Pa

1 bar = 105 Pa

1 torr = 133 Pa = 0.133 kPa

1 mm ong = 1 torr = 133 Pa

5. Pascal’s law states that: Pressure in a ﬂuid at rest is same at all points which are at
the same height. A change in pressure applied to an enclosed ﬂuid is transmitted
undiminished to every point of the ﬂuid and the walls of the containing vessel.

6. The pressure in a ﬂuid varies with depth h according to the expression

P=Pa+pgh

where p is the density of the ﬂuid, assumed uniform.

7. The volume of an incompressible ﬂuid passing any point every second in a pipe of
non uniform crossection is the same in the steady ﬂow.
1) A = constant ( v is the velocity and A is the area of crossection)
The equation is due to mass conservation in incompressible ﬂuid ﬂow.
