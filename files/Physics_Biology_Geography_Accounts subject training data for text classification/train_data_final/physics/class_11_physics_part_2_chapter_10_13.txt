(At). During this time interval the liquid has

undergone a shear strain of

Ax/ I. Since, the strain in a ﬂowing ﬂuid

increases with time continuously. Unlike a solid,

here the stress is found experimentally to depend

on ‘rate of change of strain’ or ‘strain rate’ i.e.

Ax/ (I At) or v/ 1 instead of strain itself. The

coefficient of viscosity (pronounced ‘eta’) for a

ﬂuid is defined as the ratio of shearing stress to

the strain rate.

The SI unit of viscosity is poiseiulle (Pl). Its
other units are N s m‘2 or Pa s. The dimensions
of viscosity are [ML'ITl]. Generally, thin liquids,
like water, alcohol, etc., are less viscous than
thick liquids, like coal tar, blood, glycerine, etc.

ﬂuids are listed in Table 10.2. We point out two
facts about blood and water that you may find
interesting. As Table 10.2 indicates, blood is
‘thicker’ (more viscous) than water. Further, the
relative viscosity (n/nvater) of blood remains
constant between 0 0C and 37 0C.

The viscosity of liquids decreases with
temperature, while it increases in the case of gases.

Example 1 0.9A metal block of area 0. 10 m2
is connected to a 0.010 kg mass via a string
that passes over an ideal pulley (considered

massless and frictionless). as in Fig. 10. 15.
A liquid with a film thickness of 0.30 mm

is placed between the block and the table.
When released the block moves to the right
with a constant speed of 0.085 m 5". Find
the coefficient of viscosity of the liquid.

 

Answer The metal block moves to the right
because of the tension in the string. The tension
T is equal in magnitude to the weight of the
suspended mass m. Thus, the shear force F is
