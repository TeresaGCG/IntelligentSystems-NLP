THERMAL PROPERTIES OF MA’I'I‘ER
—

Heat is a fonn of energy that ﬂows between a body and its surrounding medium by
virtue of temperature difference between them. The degree of hotness of the body is
quantitatively represented by temperature.

A temperature—measuring device (thermometer) makes use of some measurable property
(called thermometric property) that. changes with temperature. Different thermometers
lead to different temperature scales. To construct a temperature scale. two fixed points
are chosen and assigned some arbitrary values of temperature. The two numbers fix
the origin of the scale and the size of its unit.

The Celsius temperature (t) and the Farenheit temperare (tFJare related by

tF = (9/5) tc + 32

The ideal gas equation connecting pressure (P), volume (V) and absolute temperature (’1)
is :

PV = ,uRT
where L1 is the number of moles and R is the universal gas constant.
