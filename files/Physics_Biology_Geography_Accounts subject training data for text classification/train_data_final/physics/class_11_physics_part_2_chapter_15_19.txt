reference frame of the moving observer. In this
reference frame the source and medium are
approaching at speed 1),, and the speed with
which the wave approaches is 1),, + v. Following
a similar procedure as in the previous case, we
find that the time interval between the arrival
of the first and the (n+1) th crests is

nvOT0
v0 + v

 

t+1—t1 = nTO—

n

The observer thus, measures the period of the
wave to be

 

giving

v = V0(1+ —] (15.53)

D
If :0 is small, the Doppler shift is almost same

whether it is the observer or the source moving
since Eq. (15.53) and the approximate relation
Eq. (15.51 ) are the same.

15.8.3 Both Source and Observer Moving

We will now derive a general expression for
Doppler shift when both the source and the
observer are moving. As before, let us take the
direction from the observer to the source as the
positive direction. Let the source and the
observer be moving with velocities us and v0
respectively as shown in Fig. 15.18. Suppose at
time t = O, the observer is at O1 and the source
is at SI, 01 being to the left of SI. The source
emits a wave of velocity v, of frequency v and
period TO all measured by an observer at rest
with respect to the medium. Let L be the
distance between 01 and S1 at t= 0, when the
source emits the first crest. Now, since the
observer is moving, the velocity of the wave
relative to the observer is v+ vo. Therefore, the
first crest reaches the observer at time t1 = L/
(U + v0). At time t = To, both the observer and the
source have moved to their new positions 02 and
82 respectively. The new distance between the
observer and the source, 02 82, would be
L+(vS—v0) To]. At 82, the source emits a
second crest.

observer are moving with different
velocities.

Application of Doppler effect

The change in frequency caused by a moving object
due to Doppler effect is used to measure their
velocities in diverse areas such as military.
medical science. astrophysics. etc. It is also used
by police to check over—speeding of vehicles.

A sound wave or electromagnetic wave of
known frequency is sent towards a moving object.
Some part of the wave is reﬂected from the object
and its frequency is detected by the monitoring
station. This change in frequency is called Doppler
shift.

It is used at airports to guide aircraft. and in
the military to detect enemy aircraft.
Astrophysicists use it to measure the velocities
of stars.

Doctors use it to study heart beats and blood
ﬂow in different parts of the body. Here they use
ulltrasonic waves, and in common practice. it is
called sonography. Ultrasonic waves enter the
body of the person. some of them are reﬂected
back. and give information about motion of blood
and pulsation of heart valves, as well as pulsation
of the heart of the foetus. In the case of heart.
the picture generated is called echocardiogram.

This reaches the observer at time.
t2 = To + [L + (vS — vo)To)] /(v + DD)

At time nTo the source emits its (n+1) th crest
and this reaches the observer at time

tn+1 = nTo + [L + n (vS — vo)ToH /(v + v0)
Hence, in a time interval tn+1 —t1, i.e.,

nTo+ [L+ n(vs— vo)To)] /(v+ v0) —L/(v+ v0),
