seen that for 0 as large as 20 degrees, sin 0 is
nearly the same as 9 expressed in radians.

Equation (14.27) is mathematically, identical
to Eq. (14. 1 1) except that the variable is angular
displacement. Hence we have proved that for
small 6, the motion of the bob is simple harmonic.

Now since the string of the simple pendulum
is massless, the moment of inertia I is simply
mL2. Eq. (14.28) then gives the well-known
formula for time period of a simple pendulum.

Example 14.9 What is the length of a
simple pendulum. which ticks seconds ?

Answer From Eq. (14.29), the time period of a
simple pendulum is given by,

T=27I\/Z

From this relation one gets,

The time period of a simple pendulum, which
ticks seconds, is 2 s. Therefore, for g = 9.8 m S‘2
and T = 2 s, Lis

and

 

= 9.8(m s‘2) >< 4(s2)

14.9 DAMPED SIMPLE HARMONIC MOTION

We know that the motion of a simple pendulum,
swinging in air, dies out eventually. Why does it
happen ? This is because the air drag and the
friction at the support oppose the motion of the
pendulum and dissipate its energy gradually.
The pendulum is said to execute damped
oscillations. In dampled oscillations, the energy
of the system is dissipated continuously; but,
for small damping, the oscillations remain
approximately periodic. The dissipating forces
are generally the frictional forces. To understand
the effect of such external forces on the motion
of an oscillator, let us consider a system as
shown in Fig. 14.19. Here a block of mass m
connected to an elastic spring of spring constant
k oscillates vertically. If the block is pushed down
a little and released, its angular frequency of

k

oscillation is (0: a , as seen in Eq. (14.20).

However, in practice, the surrounding medium
(air) will exert a damping force on the motion of
the block and the mechanical energy of the
block-spring system will decrease. The energy
loss will appear as heat of the surrounding
medium (and the block also) [Fig. 14.19].
