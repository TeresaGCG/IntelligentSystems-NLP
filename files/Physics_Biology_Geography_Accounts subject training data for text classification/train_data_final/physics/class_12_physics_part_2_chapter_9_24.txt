9.7. 1 The rainbow

The rainbow is an example of the dispersion of sunlight by the water
drops in the atmosphere. This is a phenomenon due to combined effect
of dispersion, refraction and reﬂection of sunlight by spherical water
droplets of rain. The conditions for observing a rainbow are that the Sun
should be shining in one part of the sky (say near western horizon) while
it is raining in the opposite part of the sky (say eastern horizon).
An observer can therefore see a rainbow only when his back is towards
the Sun.

In order to understand the formation of rainbows, consider
Fig. 9.25(a). Sunlight is first refracted as it enters a raindrop, which causes
the different wavelengths (colours) of white light to separate. Longer
wangelength of light (red) are bent the least while the shorter wavelength
(violet) are bent the most. Next, these component rays strike the inner
surface of the water drop and get internally reﬂected if the angle between
the refracted ray and normal to the drop surface is greater then the critical
angle (48° in this case). The reﬂected light is refracted again when it comes
out of the drop, as shown in the figure. It is found that the violet light
emerges at an angle of 40° related to the incoming sunlight and red light
emerges at an angle of 42°. For other colours, angles lie in between these
two values.

Figure 9.25(b) explains the formation of primary rainbow. We see
that red light from drop 1 and violet light from drop 2 reach the observer’s
eye. The violet from drop 1 and red light from drop 2 are directed at level
above or below the observer. Thus the observer sees a rainbow with
red colour on the top and violet on the bottom. The primary
rainbow is a result of three-step process, that is, refraction, reﬂection
and refraction.
