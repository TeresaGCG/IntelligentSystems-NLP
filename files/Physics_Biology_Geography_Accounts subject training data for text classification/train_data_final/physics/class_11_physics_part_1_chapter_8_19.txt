weigh half way down to the centre of the earth if it weighed 250 N on the surface ?
A rocket is fired vertically with a speed of 5 km s’1 from the earth’s surface. How far
from the earth does the rocket go before returning to the earth ? Mass of the earth
= 6.0 x 1024 kg; mean radius of the earth = 6.4 x 106 m; G = 6.67 x 10’11 N m2 kg’2.
The escape speed of a projectile on the earth’s surface is 11.2 km s4. A body is
projected out with thrice this speed. What is the speed of the body far away from the
earth? Ignore the presence of the sun and other planets.

A satellite orbits the earth at a height of 400 km above the surface. How much
energy must be expended to rocket the satellite out of the earth's gravitational
inﬂuence? Mass of the satellite = 200 kg; mass of the earth = 6.0><1024 kg; radius of
the earth = 6.4 x 106 m; G = 6.67 x 10’11 N m2 kg’z.

Two stars each of one solar mass [= 2><1030 kg] are approaching each other for a head
on collision. When they are a distance 109 km, their speeds are negligible. What is
the speed with which they collide ? The radius of each star is 104 km. Assume the
stars to remain undistorted until they collide. [Use the known value of G).

Two heavy spheres each of mass 100 kg and radius 0.10 m are placed 1.0 m apart
on a horizontal table. What is the gravitational force and potential at the mid point
of the line joining the centres of the spheres ? Is an object placed at that point in
equilibrium? If so, is the equilibrium stable or unstable ?

As you have learnt in the text, a geostationary satellite orbits the earth at a height of
nearly 36,000 km from the surface of the earth. What is the potential due to earth’s
gravity at the site of this satellite ? (Take the potential energy at infinity to be zero).
Mass of the earth = 6.0><1024 kg, radius = 6400 km.

A star 2.5 times the mass of the sun and collapsed to a size of 12 km rotates with a
speed of 1.2 rev. per second. (Extremely compact stars of this kind are known as
neutron stars. Certain stellar objects called pulsars belong to this category]. Will an
object placed on its equator remain stuck to its surface due to gravity ? [mass of the
sun = 2x1050 kg).

A spaceship is stationed on Mars. How much energy must be expended on the
spaceship to launch it out of the solar system ? Mass of the space ship = 1000 kg;
mass of the sun = 2><1030 kg; mass of mars = 6.4)(1023 kg; radius of mars = 3395 km;
radius of the orbit of mars = 2.28 ><108 km; G = 6.67><10’11 N m2 kgz.

A rocket is fired ‘vertically’ from the surface of mars with a speed of 2 km s’l. If 20%
of its initial energy is lost due to martian atmospheric resistance, how far will the
rocket go from the surface of mars before returning to it ? Mass of mars = 6.4)(1023 kg;
radius of mars = 3395 km; G = 6.67><10’11 N m2 kgz.
