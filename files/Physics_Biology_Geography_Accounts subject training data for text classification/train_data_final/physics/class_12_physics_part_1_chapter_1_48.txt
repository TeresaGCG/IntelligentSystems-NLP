1.27 In a certain region of space, electric field is along the z-direction
throughout. The magnitude of electric field is, however, not constant
but increases uniformly along the positive z-direction, at the rate of
105 NC‘1 per metre. What are the force and torque experienced by a
system having a total dipole moment equal to 10’7 Cm in the negative
z-direction ?

1.28 (a) A conductor A with a cavity as shown in Fig. 1.36(a) is given a
charge Q. Show that the entire charge must appear on the outer
surface of the conductor. (b) Another conductor B with charge q is
inserted into the cavity keeping B insulated from A. Show that the
total charge on the outside surface of A is Q + q [Fig. 1.36(b)]. (c) A
sensitive instrument is to be shielded from the strong electrostatic
fields in its environment. Suggest a possible way.

1.29 A hollow charged conductor has a tiny hole cut into its surface.

Show that the electric field in the hole is (6/280) :1, where n is the
unit vector in the outward normal direction, and a is the surface
charge density near the hole.

1.30 Obtain the formula for the electric field due to a long thin wire of
uniform linear charge density E without using Gauss’s law. [Hint
Use Coulomb’s law directly and evaluate the necessary integral]

1.31 It is now believed that protons and neutrons (which constitute nuclei
of ordinary matter) are themselves built out of more elementary units
called quarks. A proton and a neutron consist of three quarks each.
Two types of quarks, the so called ‘up’ quark (denoted by u) of charge
+ (2/3) 6, and the ‘down’ quark (denoted by d) of charge [—1/3) e,
together with electrons build up ordinary matter. (Quarks of other
types have also been found which give rise to different unusual
varieties of matter.) Suggest a possible quark composition of a
proton and neutron.
