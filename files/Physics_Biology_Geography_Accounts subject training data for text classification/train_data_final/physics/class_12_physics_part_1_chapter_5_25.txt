6. Three quantities are needed to specify the magnetic ﬁeld of the earth
on its surface — the horizontal component, the magnetic declination,
and the magnetic dip. These are known as the elements of the earth’s
magnetic ﬁeld.

7. Consider a material placed in an external magnetic field B0. The
magnetic intensity is deﬁned as,

H=ﬁ

#0
The magnetisation M of the material is its dipole moment per unit volume.

The magnetic ﬁeld B in the material is,
B = #0 (H + M)

8. For a linear material M = 25 H. So that B = [J H and 25 is called the
magnetic susceptibility of the material. The three quantities, 25, the
relative magnetic permeability yr, and the magnetic permeability y are
related as follows:

,u = [Jo l~lr
Iir = 1+ 76

9. Magnetic materials are broadly classiﬁed as: diamagnetic, paramagnetic,
and ferromagnetic. For diamagnetic materials. 25% negative and small
and for paramagnetiomateriéals it is positiVe: and small. Ferromagnetic
materials have large 254and are characterised by non-linear relation
between B and.H. They show the property of hysteresis.

10. Substances,_ which at room temperature, retain their ferromagnetic
property fOr a long period of time areacalled permanent magnets.
