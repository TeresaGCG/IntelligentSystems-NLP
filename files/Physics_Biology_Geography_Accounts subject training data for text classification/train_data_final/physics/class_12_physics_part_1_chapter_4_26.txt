the coil to be angle 0 (The previous case
corresponds to 6 = 7c/ 2). Figure 4.22 illustrates
this general case.

The forces on the arms BC and DA are equal,
opposite, and act along the axis of the coil, which
connects the centres of mass of BC and DA. Being
collinear along the axis they cancel each other,
resulting in no net force or torque. The forces on
arms AB and CD are F1 and F2. They too are equal
and opposite, with magnitude,

F1 = F2 = I b B

But they are not collinear! This results in a
couple as before. The torque is, however, less than
the earlier case when plane of loop was along the
magnetic field. This is because the perpendicular
distance between the forces of the couple has
decreased. Figure 4.22(b) is a view of the
arrangement from the AD end and it illustrates

these two forces constituting a couple. The
magnitude of the torque on the loop is,

makes the forces collinear and the net force and

torque zero. The torques in Eqs. (4.26) and (4.27)
can be expressed as vector product of the magnetic moment of the coil
and the magnetic field. We define the magnetic moment of the current
loop as,

m = IA (4.28)
where the direction of the area vectorA is given by the right-hand thumb
rule and is directed into the plane of the paper in Fig. 4.2 1. Then as the
angle between m and B is 0 , Eqs. (4.26) and (4.27) can be expressed by
one expression

”C = mxB (4.29)

This is analogous to the electrostatic case (Electric dipole of dipole
moment pe in an electric field E).

As is clear from Eq. (4.28), the dimensions of the magnetic moment are
[A] [L2] and its unit is Am2.

From Eq. (4.29), we see that the torque 1: vanishes when m is either
parallel or antiparallel to the magnetic field B. This indicates a state of
equilibrium as there is no torque on the coil (this also applies to any
object with a magnetic moment :11). When m and B are parallel the
