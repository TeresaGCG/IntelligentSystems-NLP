p = mv,
l=(Omev)+(Cmev)

The magnitude of the linear velocity v of the
particle at P is given by v = cori where ri is the
length of GP or the perpendicular distance of P
from the axis of rotation. Further, v is tangential
at P to the circle which the particle describes.
Using the right-hand rule one can check that
Cva is parallel to the fixed axis. The unit
vector along the fixed axis (chosen as the z—axis)
is 1; . Hence

/\

CP><mv=rl(mv)k

= mrfw’ﬁ (since v: 6011)

Similarly, we can check that 00 Xv is
perpendicular to the fixed axis. Let us denote
the part of 1 along the fixed axis (i.e. the z-axis)
by 12, then

lZ = Cmev = mrfwﬁ

and l=lZ+OC><mv

We note that 12 is parallel to the fixed axis,
but] is not. In general, for a particle, the angular
momentum l is not along the axis of rotation,
i.e. for a particle, l and a) are not necessarily
parallel. Compare this with the corresponding
fact in translation. For a particle, p and v are
always parallel to each other.

For computing the total angular momentum
of the whole rigid body, we add up the
contribution of each particle of the body.

Thus L=Zli=21iz +20Ci xmivi

We denote by L i and LZ the components

of L respectively perpendicular to the z—axis
and along the z-axis;

Li = Z 00, x mivi (7.44a)

where m. and vi are respectively the mass and
the velocity of the Eh particle and C1 is the centre
of the circle described by the particle;

and Lz=zliz=[z mirizjwk

or L2 2 leaf: (7.44b)

The last step follows since the perpendicular
distance of the {“1 particle from the axis is r1;
and by definition the moment of inertia of the

body about the axis of rotation is I = 2 min? .

Note L =LZ + Ll (7.44c)

The rigid bodies which we have mainly
considered in this chapter are symmetric about
the axis of rotation, i.e. the axis of rotation is
one of their symmetry axes. For such bodies,
for a given 00‘, for every particle which has a
velocity vi , there is another particle of velocity
—vi located diametrically opposite on the circle
with centre Ci described by the particle. Together

such pairs will contribute zero to L l and as a

result for symmetric bodies L i is zero, and
hence

L = L2 = Ian? (7.44d)

For bodies, which are not symmetric about
the axis of rotation, L is not equal to L2 and
hence L does not lie along the axis of rotation.

Referring to Table 7. 1, can you tell in which
cases L = szill not apply?

Let us differentiate Eq. (7 .44b). Since f! is a
fixed (constant) vector, we get

Now, Eq. (7 .28b) states

As we have seen in the last section, only
those components of the external torques which

are along the axis of rotation, need to be taken
into account, when we discuss rotation about a

fixed axis. This means we can take 1: = TE.

Since L = LZ + L i and the direction of LZ (vector

f! ) is fixed, it follows that for rotation about a
fixed axis,

dt = 1k (7 .45a)

and 01: =0 (7.45b)

Thus, for rotation about a fixed axis, the
component of angular momentum
perpendicular to the fixed axis is constant. As

L2 :10]; , we get from Eq. (7.45a),
