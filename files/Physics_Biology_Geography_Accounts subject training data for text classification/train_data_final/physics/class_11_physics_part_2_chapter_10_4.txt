In the experiment it is found that the mercury
column in the barometer has a height of about
76 cm at sea level equivalent to one atmosphere
(1 atm). This can also be obtained using the
value of p in Eq. (10.8). A common way of stating
pressure is in terms of cm or m of mercury
(Hg). A pressure equivalent of 1 mm is called a
torr (after Torricelli).

1 torr = 133 Pa.

The mm of Hg and torr are used in medicine
and physiology. In meteorology, a common unit
is the bar and millibar.

1 bar = 105 Pa

An open tube manometer is a useful
instrument for measuring pressure differences.
It consists of a U-tube containing a suitable
liquid i.e., a low density liquid (such as oil) for
measuring small pressure differences and a
high density liquid (such as mercury) for large
pressure differences. One end of the tube is open
to the atmosphere and the other end is
connected to the system whose pressure we want
to measure [see Fig. 10.5 (b)]. The pressure Pat
A is equal to pressure at point B. What we
normally measure is the gauge pressure, which
is P—Pa, given by Eq. (10.8) and is proportional
to manometer height h.

Pressure is same at the same level on both
sides of the U-tube containing a ﬂuid. For
liquids, the density varies very little over wide
ranges in pressure and temperature and we can
treat it safely as a constant for our present
purposes. Gases on the other hand, exhibits
large variations of densities with changes in
pressure and temperature. Unlike gases, liquids
are, therefore, largely treated as incompressible.

Example 10.3 The density of the
atmosphere at sea level is 1.29 kg/m“.

Assume that it does not change with
altitude. Then how high would the
atmosphere extend?

 

AnswerWe use Eq. (10.7)
pgh = 1.29kgm“3>< 9.8ms2x h m= 1.01>< 105Pa

.-.h= 7989mz8km

In reality the density of air decreases with
height. So does the value of g. The atmospheric
cover extends with decreasing pressure over
100 km. We should also note that the sea level
atmospheric pressure is not always 760 mm of
Hg. A drop in the Hg level by 10 mm or more is a
sign of an approaching storm. 4
