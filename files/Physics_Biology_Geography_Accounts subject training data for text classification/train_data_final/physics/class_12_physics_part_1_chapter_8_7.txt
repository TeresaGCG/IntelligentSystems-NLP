The relation 0) = ck is the standard one for waves (see for example,
Section 15.4 of class XI Physics textbook). This relation is often written
in terms of frequency, v (=co/27t) and wavelength, 1 (=21: / k) as

It is also seen from Maxwell’s equations that the magnitude of the
electric and the magnetic fields in an electromagnetic wave are related as

B0 = (EC/c) (8.10)

We here make remarks on some features of electromagnetic waves.
They are self-sustaining oscillations of electric and magnetic ﬁelds in free
space, or vacuum. They differ from all the other waves we have studied
so far, in respect that no material medium is involved in the Vibrations of
the electric and magnetic ﬁelds. Sound waves in air are longitudinal waves
of compression and rarefaction. Transverse elastic (sound) waves can
also propagate in a solid, which is rigid and that resists shear. Scientists
in the nineteenth century were so much used to this mechanical picture
that they thought that there must be some medium pervading all space
and all matter, which responds to electric and magnetic fields just as any
elastic medium does. They called this medium ether. They were so
convinced of the reality of this medium, that there is even a novel called
The Poison Belt by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (the creator of the famous
detective Sherlock Holmes) where the solar system is supposed to pass
through a poisonous region of ether! We now accept that no such physical
medium is needed. The famous experiment of Michelson and Morley in
1887 demolished conclusively the hypothesis of ether. Electric and
magnetic fields, oscillating in space and time, can sustain each other in
vacuum.

But what if a material medium is actually there? We know that light,
an electromagnetic wave, does propagate through glass, for example. We
have seen earlier that the total electric and magnetic fields inside a
medium are described in terms of a permittivity s and a magnetic
permeability ,u (these describe the factors by which the total fields differ
from the external fields). These replace so and [.10 in the description to
electric and magnetic fields in Maxwell’s equations with the result that in
a material medium of permittivity e and magnetic permeability u, the
velocity of light becomes,

U = x/E (8.1 1)
Thus, the velocity of light depends on electric and magnetic properties of

the medium. We shall see in the next chapter that the refractive index of
one medium with respect to the other is equal to the ratio of velocities of
light in the two media.

The velocity of electromagnetic waves in free space or vacuum is an
important fundamental constant. It has been shown by experiments on
electromagnetic waves of different wavelengths that this velocity is the
