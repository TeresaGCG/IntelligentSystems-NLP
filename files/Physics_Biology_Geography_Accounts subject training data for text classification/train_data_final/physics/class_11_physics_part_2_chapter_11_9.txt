Triple Point

The temperature of a substance remains constant. during its change of state (phase change).
A graph between the temperature T and the Pressure P of the substance is called a phase
diagram or P — T diagram. The following figure shows the phase diagram of water and C02.
Such a phase diagram divides the P — T plane into a solid-region, the vapour—region and the
liquid—region. The regions are separated by the curves such as sublimation curve (BO). fusion
curve (A0) and vaporisation curve (CO). The points on sublimation curve represent states
in which solid and vapour phases coexist. The point on the sublimation curve BO represent
states in which the solid and vapour phases co-exist. Points on the fusion curve AO represent
states in which solid and liquid phase coexist. Points on the vapourisation curve CO represent
states in which the liquid and vapour phases coexist. The temperature and pressure at which
the fusion curve, the vaporisation curve and the sublimation curve meet and all the three
phases of a substance coexist is called the triple point of the substance. For example the
triple point of water is represented by the temperature 273.16 K and pressure 6.1 1X10’3 Pa.
