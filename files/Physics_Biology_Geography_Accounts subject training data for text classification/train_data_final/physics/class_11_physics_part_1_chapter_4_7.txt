Answer Let OP and 09 represent the two vectors
A and B making an angle 0 (Fig. 4.10). Then,
using the parallelogram method of vector
addition, OS represents the resultant vector R :
R = A + B
SN is normal to OP and PM is normal to OS.
From the geometry of the figure,
0S2 = 0N2 + SN2

but ON=OP+PN=A+Bcos0
SN=Bsin0
OSZ= (A+Bcos (9)2 + (B sin 0)2

or, R2=A2+BZ+2AB cosO

 

 

R = A2 + B2 + 2AB cos 6 (424a)
In A OSN, SN = OS sina= R sina, and
inAPSN, SN=PSsin9=Bsin0
Therefore, R sin a = B sin (9

Using Eq. (4.24d), we get:

where R is given by Eq. (4.24a).

or, tan 0!: (4.24f)

OP+PN = A+Bcost9

Equation (4.24a) gives the magnitude of the
resultant and Eqs. (4. 24e) and (4.24f) its direction.
Equation (4.24a) is known as the Law of cosines
and Eq. (4.24d) as the Law of sines. 4

> Example 4.3 A motorboat is racing
towards north at 25 km/h and the water
current in that region is 10 km/h in the

direction of 60° east of south. Find the
resultant velocity of the boat.

Answer The vector vb representing the velocity
of the motorboat and the vector vc representing
the water current are shown in Fig. 4.11 in
directions specified by the problem. Using the
parallelogram method of addition, the resultant
R is obtained in the direction shown in the
figure.

We can obtain the magnitude of R using the Law
of cosine :
