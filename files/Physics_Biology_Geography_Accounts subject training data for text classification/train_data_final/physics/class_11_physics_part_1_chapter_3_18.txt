Read each statement below carefully and state with reasons and examples, if it is
true or false ;

A particle in one—dimensional motion

(a) with zero speed at an instant may have non-zero acceleration at that instant
[b] with zero speed may have non—zero velocity,

[0] with constant speed must have zero acceleration,

[d] with positive value of acceleration must be speeding up.

A ball is dropped from a height of 90 m on a ﬂoor. At each collision with the ﬂoor,

the ball loses one tenth of its speed. Plot the speed—time graph of its motion
between t = 0 to 12 s.

Explain clearly, with examples, the distinction between :

(a) magnitude of displacement [sometimes called distance) over an interval of time,
and the total length of path covered by a particle over the same interval;

[b] magnitude of average velocity over an interval of time, and the average speed
over the same interval. [Average speed of a particle over an interval of time is
defined as the total path length divided by the time interval]. Show in both [a]
and (b) that the second quantity is either greater than or equal to the first.

When is the equality sign true ? [For simplicity, consider one—dimensional
motion only].

A man walks on a straight road from his home to a market 2.5 km away with a

speed of 5 km h‘l. Finding the market closed, he instantly turns and walks back

home with a speed of 7.5 km h‘l. What is the

(a) magnitude of average velocity, and

[b] average speed of the man over the interval of time (i) 0 to 30 min, (ii) 0 to
50 min, [iii] 0 to 40 min ? [Note: You will appreciate from this exercise why it
is better to define average speed as total path length divided by time, and not
as magnitude of average velocity. You would not like to tell the tired man on
his return home that his average speed was zero !]

In Exercises 3.13 and 3. 14, we have carefully distinguished between average speed
and magnitude of average velocity. No such distinction is necessary when we
consider instantaneous speed and magnitude of velocity. The instantaneous speed
is always equal to the magnitude of instantaneous velocity. Why ?

Look at the graphs (a) to [d] (Fig. 3.20] carefully and state, with reasons, which of
these cannot possibly represent one—dimensional motion of a particle.
