particles. The centre of mass of the system is
that point C which is at a distance X from 0,
where X is given by
mlx1 + m2x2
m1 + m2

X = (7.1)
In Eq. (7.1), X can be regarded as the mass-
weighted mean of x1 and x2. If the two particles
have the same mass m1 = m2 = m~ then
mx1 + mx2 x1 + x2

X:—:
2m 2

Thus, for two particles of equal mass the
centre of mass lies exactly midway between
them.

 

If we have n particles of masses m1, m2,
...mn respectively, along a straight line taken as
the x— axis, then by definition the position of the
centre of the mass of the system of particles is
given by.

where x1, x2,...xn are the distances of the
particles from the origin; X is also measured from

the same origin. The symbol 2 (the Greek letter

sigma) denotes summation, in this case over n
particles. The sum

2mi=M

is the total mass of the system.

Suppose that we have three particles, not
lying in a straight line. We may define x— and y—
axes in the plane in which the particles lie and
represent the positions of the three particles by
coordinates (x1,y1), (x2,y2) and (x3,y3) respectively.
Let the masses of the three particles be m1, m2
and m3 respectively. The centre of mass C of
the system of the three particles is defined and
located by the coordinates (X, Y) given by

mlxl + m2x2 + m3x3

Thus, for three particles of equal mass, the
centre of mass coincides with the centroid of the
triangle formed by the particles.

Results of Eqs. (7.3a) and (7.3b) are
generalised easily to a system of n particles, not
necessarily lying in a plane, but distributed in
space. The centre of mass of such a system is
at (X, Y, Z), where

Here M = Zmi is the total mass of the

system. The index iruns from 1 to n; mi is the
mass of the {Lh particle and the position of the
{“1 particle is given by (xi, yi, zi).

Eqs. (7.4a), (7.4b) and (7.4c) can be
combined into one equation using the notation

of position vectors. Let ri be the position vector

of the {Lh particle and R be the position vector of
the centre of mass:

ri =xi i+yi j+zik

and R=Xi+Yj+Zﬁ

Then R = (7-4d)

The sum on the right hand side is a vector
sum.
Note the economy of expressions we achieve
by use of vectors. If the origin of the frame of
reference (the coordinate system) is chosen to

 

be the centre of mass then Emir, : Ofor the

given system of particles.

A rigid body, such as a metre stick or a
ﬂywheel, is a system of closely packed particles;
Eqs. (7.4a), (7.4b), (7.4c) and (7.4d) are
therefore, applicable to a rigid body. The number
of particles (atoms or molecules) in such a body
is so large that it is impossible to carry out the
summations over individual particles in these
equations. Since the spacing of the particles is
