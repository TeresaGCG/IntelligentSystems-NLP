4.8. 1 The solenoid

We shall discuss a long solenoid. By long solenoid we mean that the
solenoid’s length is large compared to its radius. It consists of a long
wire wound in the form of a helix where the neighbouring turns are closely
spaced. So each turn can be regarded as a circular loop. The net magnetic
ﬁeld is the vector sum of the ﬁelds due to all the turns. Enamelled wires
are used for winding so that turns are insulated from each other.

stretched out for clarity. Only the exterior semi—circular part is shown. Notice
how the circular loops between neighbouring turns tend to cancel.

(b) The magnetic ﬁeld of a ﬁnite solenoid.

Figure 4.17 displays the magnetic ﬁeld lines for a ﬁnite solenoid. We
show a section of this solenoid in an enlarged manner in Fig. 4.17(a).
Figure 4. 17 (b) shows the entire ﬁnite solenoid with its magnetic field. In
Fig. 4.1 7(a), it is clear from the circular loops that the ﬁeld between two
neighbouring turns vanishes. In Fig. 4.17(b), we see that the ﬁeld at the
interior mid-point P is uniform, strong and along the axis of the solenoid.
The ﬁeld at the exterior mid-point Q is weak and moreover is along the
axis of the solenoid with no perpendicular or normal component. As the
solenoid is made longer it appears like a long cylindrical metal sheet.
Figure 4.18 represents this idealised picture. The ﬁeld outside the solenoid
approaches zero. We shall assume that the ﬁeld outside is zero. The field

inside becomes everywhere parallel to the axis.

rectangular Arnperian loop abcd to determine the field.
