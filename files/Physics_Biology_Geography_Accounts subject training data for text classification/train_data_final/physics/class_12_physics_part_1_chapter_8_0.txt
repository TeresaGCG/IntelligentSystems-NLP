8. 1 INTRODUCTION

In Chapter 4, we learnt that an electric current produces magnetic ﬁeld
and that two current-carrying wires exert a magnetic force on each other.
Further, in Chapter 6, we have seen that a magnetic ﬁeld changing with
time gives rise to an electric ﬁeld. Is the converse also true? Does an
electric ﬁeld changing with time give rise to a magnetic ﬁeld? James Clerk
Maxwell (1831- 1879), argued that this was indeed the case — not only
an electric current but also a time-varying electric ﬁeld generates magnetic
ﬁeld. While applying the Ampere’s circuital law to ﬁnd magnetic ﬁeld at a
point outside a capacitor connected to a time-varying current, Maxwell
noticed an inconsistency in the Ampere’s circuital law. He suggested the
existence of an additional current, called by him, the displacement
current to remove this inconsistency.

Maxwell formulated a set of equations involving electric and magnetic
fields, and their sources, the charge and current densities. These
equations are known as Maxwell’s equations. Together with the Lorentz
force formula (Chapter 4), they mathematically express all the basic laws
of electromagnetism.

The most important prediction to emerge from Maxwell’s equations
is the existence of electromagnetic waves, which are (coupled) time-
varying electric and magnetic ﬁelds that propagate in space. The speed
of the waves, according to these equations, turned out to be very close to
