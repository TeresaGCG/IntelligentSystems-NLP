Example 9.4 Suppose while sitting in a parked car, you notice a
jogger approaching towards you in the side view mirror of R = 2 m. If
the jogger is running at a speed of 5 m s‘l, how fast the image of the
jogger appear to move when the jogger is (a) 39 m, (b) 29 m, (c) 19 m,
and (d) 9 m away.
Solution
From the mirror equation, Eq. (9.7), we get
U: f u
u — f
For convex mirror, since R = 2 m, f = l m. Then
f _ 39 v_(—39)xl_§m
oru" 1‘" —39—1 40
Since the jogger moves at a constant speed of 5 m s‘l, after 1 s the
position of the image I) (for u = —39 + 5 = —34) is (34/35 )m.
The shift in the position of image in 1 s is
39_34 _ 1365—1360 _ 5 _ 1 m
40 35 ' 1400 _ 1400 ' 280
Therefore, the average speed of the image when the jogger is between
39 m and 34 m from the mirror, is (l / 280) m s"1
Similarly, it can be seen that for u = —29 m, —19 m and —9 m, the
speed with which the image appears to move is
lims‘1 ims'1 and ims'1 t' 1
150 , 60 10 , respec 1ve y.
<1: Although the jogger has been moving with a constant speed, the speed
05 of his/her image appears to increase substantially as he/ she moves
E closer to the mirror. This phenomenon can be noticed by any person
9' sitting in a stationary car or a bus. In case of moving vehicles, a
5 similar phenomenon could be observed if the vehicle in the rear is
a moving closer with a constant speed.
9.3 REFRACTION
When a beam of light encounters another transparent medium, a part of
light gets reﬂected back into the ﬁrst medium while the rest enters the
other. A ray of light represents a beam. The direction of propagation of an
3 1 6 obliquely incident (O°< i< 90°) ray of light that enters the other medium,
