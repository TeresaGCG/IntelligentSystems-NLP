Magnetism and

 

Example 5.5 Figure 5.5 shows a small magnetised needle P placed at

a point 0. The arrow shows the direction of its magnetic moment. The

other arrows show different positions (and orientations of the magnetic

moment) of another identical magnetised needle Q.

(a) In which configuration the system is not in equilibrium?

(b) In which configuration is the system in (i) stable, and (ii) unstable
equilibrium?

(c) Which configuration corresponds to the lowest potential energy
among all the configurations shown?

Solution

Potential energy of the conﬁguration arises due to the potential energy of
one dipole (say, Q) in the magnetic ﬁeld due to other (P). Use the result
that the ﬁeld due to P is given by the expression [Eqs. (5.7) and (5.8)]:

 

m

B? = _:—:rr—; (on the normal bisector)
2 m

Bp = :0” r—; (on the axis)

where mP is the magnetic moment of the dipole P.

Equilibrium is stable when m is parallel to BP, and unstable when it
is anti-parallel to BP.

For instance for the configuration gs for which Q is along the
perpendicular bisector of the dipole P, the magnetic moment of Q is
parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld at the position 3. Hence QS is stable.
Thus,

5.3 MAGNETISM AND GAUSS’S LAW

In Chapter 1, we studied Gauss’s law for electrostatics. In Fig 5.3(c), we
see that for a closed surface represented by ©, the number of lines leaving
the surface is equal to the number of lines entering it. This is consistent
with the fact that no net charge is enclosed by the surface. However, in
the same ﬁgure, for the closed surface®, there is a net outward ﬂux, since
it does include a net (positive) charge.
