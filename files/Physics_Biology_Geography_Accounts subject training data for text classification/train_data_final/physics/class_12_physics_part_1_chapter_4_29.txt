As earlier, we deﬁne the magnetic moment m to have a magnitude IA,

The expression of Eq. [4.3 1(a)] is very similar to an expression obtained

earlier for the electric field of a dipole. The similarity may be seen if we
substitute,

B _> E (electrostatic field)

We then obtain,

which is precisely the field for an electric dipole at a point on its axis.
considered in Chapter 1, Section 1.10 [Eq. (1.20)].

It can be shown that the above analogy can be carried further. We
had found in Chapter 1 that the electric field on the perpendicular bisector
of the dipole is given by [See Eq.(1.2 1)],

 

where xis the distance from the dipole. If we replace p 9 m and #0 —> 1 / 80

in the above expression, we obtain the result for B for a point in the
plane of the loop at a distance x from the centre. For x >>R,
B : “0 m

The results given by Eqs. [4.31(a)] and [4.31(b)] become exact for a
point magnetic dipole.

The results obtained above can be shown to apply to any planar loop:
a planar current loop is equivalent to a magnetic dipole of dipole moment
m = IA, which is the analogue of electric dipole moment p. Note, however,
a fundamental difference: an electric dipole is built up of two elementary
units — the charges (or electric monopoles). In magnetism, a magnetic
dipole (or a current loop) is the most elementary element. The equivalent
of electric charges, i.e., magnetic monopoles, are not known to exist.

We have shown that a current loop (i) produces a magnetic field (see
Fig. 4.1 2) and behaves like a magnetic dipole at large distances, and
