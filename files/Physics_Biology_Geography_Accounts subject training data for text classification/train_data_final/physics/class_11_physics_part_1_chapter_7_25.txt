Planar Body

 

Fig. 7.29 Theorem of perpendicular axes
applicable to a planar body; x and y axes
are two perpendicular axes in the plane
and the z—axis is perpendicular to the
plane.

The figure shows a planar body. An axis
perpendicular to the body through a point 0 is
taken as the z—axis. Two mutually perpendicular
axes lying in the plane of the body and
concurrent with z—axis, i.e., passing through 0,
are taken as the x and y-axes. The theorem
states that

[Z = IX + 1y (7.36)

Let us look at the usefulness of the theorem
through an example.

> Example 7.10 What is the moment of
inertia of a disc about one of its diameters?

Answer We assume the moment of inertia of
the disc about an axis perpendicular to it and
through its centre to be known; it is MR2/ 2,
where M is the mass of the disc and R is its
radius (Table 7.1)

The disc can be considered to be a planar
body. Hence the theorem of perpendicular axes
is applicable to it. As shown in Fig. 7 .30, we
take three concurrent axes through the centre
of the disc, 0, as the x—, y— and z—axes; x— and
y—axes lie in the plane of the disc and z—axis is
perpendicular to it. By the theorem of
perpendicular axes,

IZ=IX+Iy

Now, x and y axes are along two diameters
of the disc, and by symmetry the moment of
inertia of the disc is the same about any
diameter. Hence

IX = Iy
and IZ = 21X
But 12 = MR2/ 2

So finally, IX = [2/2 = MR2/4
Thus the moment of inertia of a disc about
any of its diameter is MR2 / 4 . 4

Find similarly the moment of inertia of a
ring about any of its diameters. Will the theorem
be applicable to a solid cylinder?
