If the cross-sectional area of the tank A2 is
much larger than that of the hole (A2 >>A1), then
we may take the ﬂuid to be approximately at rest
at the top, i.e., v2 = 0. Now, applying the Bernoulli
equation at points 1 and 2 and noting that at
the hole P1 = Pa, the atmospheric pressure, we
have from Eq. (10.12)

1
Pa +§pv12+ pgy1=P+p gyz

Taking y2 — y1 = hwe have

2 (P _ Pa)
v1= 29 MT (10.14)
When P >>Pa and 2 g h may be ignored, the
speed of efﬂux is determined by the container
pressure. Such a situation occurs in rocket
propulsion. On the other hand, if the tank is

open to the atmosphere, then P = Pa and

v1=,)2gh (10.15)

This is also the speed of a freely falling body.
Equation (1 O. 1 5) represents Torricelli’s law.

10.4.2 Venturi-meter

The Venturi-meter is a device to measure the
ﬂow speed of incompressible ﬂuid. It consists of
a tube with a broad diameter and a small
constriction at the middle as shown in
Fig. (10.11). A manometer in the form of a
U-tube is also attached to it, with one arm at
the broad neck point of the tube and the other
at constriction as shown in Fig. (10.11). The
manometer contains a liquid of density pm. The
speed v1 of the liquid ﬂowing through the tube
at the broad neck area A is to be measured
from equation of continuity Eq. (10. 10) the speed

A

at the constriction becomes 02 =—Ul. Then
a

using Bernoulli’s equation (Eq. 10. 1 2) for (h1=h2),
we get

1 1
P1+ 2— pv12=P2+2— pv12(A/a)2
So that
1 A 2
131—132: 2— p012 3 -1 (10.16)

This pressure difference causes the ﬂuid in
the U-tube connected at the narrow neck to rise
in comparison to the other arm. The difference
in height h measure the pressure difference.

The principle behind this meter has many
applications. The carburetor of automobile has
a Venturi channel (nozzle) through which air
ﬂows with a high speed. The pressure is then
lowered at the narrow neck and the petrol
(gasoline) is sucked up in the chamber to provide
the correct mixture of air to fuel necessary for
combustion. Filter pumps or aspirators, Bunsen
burner, atomisers and sprayers [See Fig. 10.12]
used for perfumes or to spray insecticides work
on the same principle.
