2.3.2 Estimation of Very Small Distances:
Size of a Molecule

To measure a very small size, like that of a
molecule (10'8 m to 10'10 m), we have to adopt
special methods. We cannot use a screw gauge
or similar instruments. Even a microscope has
certain limitations. An optical microscope uses
visible light to ‘look’ at the system under
investigation. As light has wave like features,
the resolution to which an optical microscope
can be used is the wavelength of light (A detailed
explanation can be found in the Class XII
Physics textbook). For visible light the range of
wavelengths is from about 4000 A to 7000 A
(1 angstrom = 1 A = 10'10 m). Hence an optical
microscope cannot resolve particles with sizes
smaller than this. Instead of visible light, we can
use an electron beam. Electron beams can be
focussed by properly designed electric and
magnetic fields. The resolution of such an
electron microscope is limited finally by the fact
that electrons can also behave as waves ! (You
will learn more about this in class XII). The
wavelength of an electron can be as small as a
fraction of an angstrom. Such electron
microscopes with a resolution of 0.6 A have been
built. They can almost resolve atoms and
molecules in a material. In recent times,
tunnelling microscopy has been developed in
which again the limit of resolution is better than
an angstrom. It is possible to estimate the sizes
of molecules.

A simple method for estimating the molecular
size of oleic acid is given below. Oleic acid is a
soapy liquid with large molecular size of the
order of 10'9m.

The idea is to first form mono-molecular layer
of oleic acid on water surface.

We dissolve 1 cm3 of oleic acid in alcohol to
make a solution of 20 cm3. Then we take 1 cm3

of this solution and dilute it to 20 cm3, using
alcohol. So, the concentration of the solution is

solution. Next we lightly sprinkle some
lycopodium powder on the surface of water in a
large trough and we put one drop of this solution
in the water. The oleic acid drop spreads into a
thin, large and roughly circular film of molecular
thickness on water surface. Then, we quickly
measure the diameter of the thin film to get its
area A. Suppose we have dropped n drops in
the water. Initially, we determine the
approximate volume of each drop (ch3).

This solution of oleic acid spreads very fast
on the surface of water and forms a very thin
layer of thickness 1:. If this spreads to form a
film of area A cm2, then the thickness of the

Ifwe assume that the ﬁlm has mono-molecular
thickness, then this becomes the size or diameter
of a molecule of oleic acid. The value of this
thickness comes out to be of the order of 10'9 m.

Example 2.5 If the size of a nucleus (in
the range of 10‘15 to 10‘14 n1) is scaled up
to the tip of a sharp pin. what roughly is

the size of an atom ? Assume tip of the pin
to be in the range lO’sm t0 10’4m.

 

Answer The size of a nucleus is in the range of
10'15 m and 10'14 m. The tip of a sharp pin is
taken to be in the range of 10'5 m and 10'4 m.
Thus we are scaling up by a factor of 1010. An
atom roughly of size 10'10 m will be scaled up to a
size of 1 m. Thus a nucleus in an atom is as small
in size as the tip of a sharp pin placed at the centre
of a sphere of radius about a metre long. 4
