are much more difficult to compress than gases
and so have much higher values of bulk modulus.
Now, see Eq. (15.19). Solids and liquids have
higher mass densities { p ) than gases. But the

corresponding increase in both the modulus (B)
of solids and liquids is much higher. This is the
reason why the sound waves travel faster in
solids and liquids.

We can estimate the speed of sound in a gas
in the ideal gas approximation. For an ideal gas,
the pressure P, volume Vand temperature T are
related by (see Chapter 1 1).

PV= NkBT (15.21)

where N is the number of molecules in volume
V, k3 is the Boltzmann constant and T the
temperature of the gas (in Kelvin). Therefore, for
an isothermal change it follows from Eq.(15.2 1)
that

 

VAP + PAV = 0
AP
or _ =
AV/ V P
Hence, substituting in Eq. (15.16), we have
B = P

Therefore, from Eq. (15.19) the speed of a
longitudinal wave in an ideal gas is given by,

v = E (15.22)
p
This relation was ﬁrst given by Newton and

is known as Newton’s formula.

Example 1 5.4 Estimate the speed of
sound in air at standard temperature and

pressure. The mass of 1 mole of air is
29.0 X10‘3k.

 

Answer We know that 1 mole of any gas

occupies 22.4 litres at STP. Therefore, density

of air at STP is:

p0 = (mass of one mole of air)/ (volume of one
mole of air at STP)

_ 29.0x10‘3 kg
22.4x10‘3 m3

= 1.29 kg m—3

According to Newton’s formula for the speed
of sound in a medium, we get for the speed of
sound in air at STP,

1.01x105Nm'2
1.29 kgm“3

The result shown in Eq.(15.23) is about 15%
smaller as compared to the experimental value
of 331 m S'1 as given in Table 15.1. Where
did we go wrong ? If we examine the basic
assumption made by Newton that the pressure
variations in a medium during propagation of
sound are isothermal, we find that this is not
correct. It was pointed out by Laplace that the
pressure variations in the propagation of sound
waves are so fast that there is little time for the
heat ﬂow to maintain constant temperature.
These variations, therefore, are adiabatic and
not isothermal. For adiabatic processes the ideal
gas satisfies the relation (see Section 12.8),

PV” = constant

i.e. A(PV7) = O

or PyVV‘1 AV+ VYAP= o

where y is the ratio of two specific heats,
Cp/Cv.

Thus, for an ideal gas the adiabatic bulk
modulus is given by,

B = _ AP
“‘1 AV/V
= IYp

The speed of sound is, therefore, from Eq.
(15.19), givenby,

v = (ﬂ (1524)
p

This modiﬁcation of Newton’s formula is referred
to as the Laplace correction. For air
7: 7/5. Now using Eq. (15.24) to estimate the speed
of sound in air at STP, we get a value 331.3 In 8—1,
which agrees with the measured speed.

 

15.5 THE PRINCIPLE 0F SUPERPOSITION
OFWAVES

What happens when two wave pulses travelling
in opposite directions cross each other
(Fig. 15.9)? It turns out that wave pulses
continue to retain their identities after they have
crossed. However, during the time they overlap,
the wave pattern is different from either of the
pulses. Figure 15.9 shows the situation when
two pulses of equal and opposite shapes move
towards each other. When the pulses overlap,
the resultant displacement is the algebraic sum
of the displacement due to each pulse. This is
known as the principle of superposition of waves.
