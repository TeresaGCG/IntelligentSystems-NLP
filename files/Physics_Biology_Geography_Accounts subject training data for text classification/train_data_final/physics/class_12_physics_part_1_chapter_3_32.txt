Electricity

 

Using E = V/l, I = nevd A, and Ohm’s law, one obtains

eE ne2
_= p

The proportionality between the force eE on the electrons in a metal

due to the external field E and the drift velocity vd (not acceleration}

can be understood, if we assume that the electrons suffer collisions

with ions in the metal, which deﬂect them randomly. If such collisions

occur on an average at a time interval 1,

 

vd

vd = at = eEr/ m
where a is the acceleration of the electron. This gives

 

_ m
’0_ ne2 1
In the temperature range in which resistivity increases linearly with
temperature, the temperature coefﬁcient of resistivity a is defined as
the fractional increase in resistivity per unit increase in temperature.

Ohm’s law is obeyed by many substances, but it is not a fundamental
law of nature. It fails if

(a) Vdepends on I non—linearly.

[b] the relation between Vand I depends on the sign of Vfor the same
absolute value of V.

(c) The relation between Vand I is non—unique.

An example of (a) is when p increases with I [even if temperature is

kept fixed). A rectifier combines features (a) and [b]. GaAs shows the

feature (c).

When a source of emf E is connected to an external resistance R, the
voltage Vext across R is given by

R + r
where r is the internal resistance of the source.

(a) Total resistance R of n resistors connected in series is given by
R = R1 + R2 + ..... + Rn
(b) Total resistance R of n resistors connected in parallel is given by

Kirchhoﬂ‘s Rules —

(a) Junction Rule: At any junction of circuit elements, the sum of
currents entering the junction must equal the sum of currents
leaving it.

(b) Loop Rule: The algebraic sum of changes in potential around any
closed loop must be zero.

The Wheatstone bridge is an arrangement of four resistances — R1, R2,
R3, R4 as shown in the text. The null—point condition is given by

RiRs

R2 R4
using which the value of one resistance can be determined, knowing
the other three resistances.

The potentiometer is a device to compare potential differences. Since
the method involves a condition of no current ﬂow, the device can be
used to measure potential difference; internal resistance of a cell and
compare emfs of two sources.
