SUMMARY

An alternating voltage U = Um Sin (0t applied to a resistor R drives a

U

m

R . The current is in phase with

current i = im sinwt in the resistor, im =

the applied voltage.

For an alternating current i = im sin cot passing through a resistor R, the
average power loss P (averaged over a cycle) due to joule heating is
(1/2 )ijnR. To express it in the same form as the dc power (P = 12R), a
special value of current is used. It is called root mean square (rms)

current and is donoted by I:

I = 1'" = 0.707 im

Similarly. the rms voltage is defined by

V = Um = 0.707vm

J5
We have P = IV = 12R

An ac voltage U = um sin cot applied to a pure inductor L, drives a current
in the inductor i = im sin (cot — n/Z), where im = vm/XL. XL = (0L is called
inductive reactance. The current in the inductor lags the voltage by
n/ 2. The average power supplied to an inductor over one complete cycle

is zero.
An ac voltage U = um sincot applied to a capacitor drives a current in the

capacitor: 1' = im sin (wt + TI/ 2). Here.

i _ X _ L . ..
m — ~ c — (0C rs called capacrtwe reactance.

The current through the capacitor is 7t/ 2 ahead of the applied voltage.
As in the case of inductor, the average power supplied to a capacitor
over one complete cycle is zero.

For a series RLC circuit driven by voltage U = um sin cut. the current is
given by i = im sin (cot + (/>)

and ¢ : tan’l H

Z = R2 +(XC —XL)2 is called the impedance of the circuit.
