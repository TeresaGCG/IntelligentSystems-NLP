near the object, one focal length away or less, and the eye is positioned
close to the lens on the other side. The idea is to get an erect, magniﬁed
and virtual image of the object at a distance so that it can be viewed
comfortably, i.e., at 25 cm or more. If the object is at a distance f, the
image is at infinity. However, if the object is at a distance slightly less
than the focal length of the lens, the image is virtual and closer than
inﬁnity. Although the closest comfortable distance for viewing the image
is when it is at the near point (distance DE 25 cm), it causes some strain
on the eye. Therefore, the image formed at infinity is often considered
most suitable for viewing by the relaxed eye. We show both cases, the
ﬁrst in Fig. 9.27 (a), and the second in Fig. 9.27[b) and (c).

The linear magniﬁcation m, for the image formed at the near point D,
by a simple microscope can be obtained by using the relation

”Eat-ﬂit?)

Now according to our sign convention, I) is negative, and is equal in
magnitude to D. Thus, the magnification is
