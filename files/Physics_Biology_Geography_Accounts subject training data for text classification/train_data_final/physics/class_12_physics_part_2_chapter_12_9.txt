object which moves in a circle is being constantly
accelerated — the acceleration being centripetal in nature.
According to classical electromagnetic theory, an
accelerating charged particle emits radiation in the form
of electromagnetic waves. The energy of an accelerating
electron should therefore, continuously decrease. The
electron would spiral inward and eventually fall into the
nucleus (Fig. 12.7). Thus, such an atom can not be stable.
Further, according to the classical electromagnetic theory,
the frequency of the electromagnetic waves emitted by
the revolving electrons is equal to the frequency of
revolution. As the electrons spiral inwards, their angular
velocities and hence their frequencies would change
continuously, and so will the frequency of the light
emitted. Thus, they would emit a continuous spectrum,
in contradiction to the line spectrum actually observed.
Clearly Rutherford model tells only a part of the story
implying that the classical ideas are not sufficient to
explain the atomic structure.

Niels Henrik David Bohr
(1885 - 1962) Danish
physicist who explained the
spectrum of hydrogen atom
based on quantum ideas.
He gave a theory of nuclear
ﬁssion based on the liquid-
drop model of nucleus.
Bohr contributed to the
clarification of conceptual
problems in quantum
mechanics, in particular by
proposing the comple-
mentary principle.

FIGURE 12.7 An accelerated atomic electron must spiral into the
nucleus as it loses energy.

Example 12.4 According to the classical electromagnetic theory,
calculate the initial frequency of the light emitted by the electron
revolving around a proton in hydrogen atom.

Solution From Example 12.3 we know that velocity of electron moving
around a proton in hydrogen atom in an orbit of radius 5.3 X 10‘11 m
is 2.2 X 10‘6 m/s. Thus, the frequency of the electron moving around
the proton is

v 2.2 x 106 m s'1

= 2—nr _ 2n(5.3><10"” m)

z 6.6 x 1015 Hz.
According to the classical electromagnetic theory we know that the
frequency of the electromagnetic waves emitted by the revolving
electrons is equal to the frequency of its revolution around the nucleus.
Thus the initial frequency of the light emitted is 6.6 X 1015 Hz.
