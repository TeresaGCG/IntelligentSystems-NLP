electron volts. On the other hand, in a nuclear reaction, the energy release
is of the order of MeV. Thus for the same quantity of matter, nuclear
sources produce a million times more energy than a chemical source.
Fission of 1 kg of uranium, for example, generates 1014 J of energy;
compare it with burning of 1 kg of coal that gives 107 J.

13.7. 1 Fission

New possibilities emerge when we go beyond natural radioactive decays
and study nuclear reactions by bombarding nuclei with other nuclear
particles such as proton, neutron, oc-particle, etc.

A most important neutron-induced nuclear reaction is ﬁssion. An

example of fission is when a uranium isotope 2325U bombarded with a
neutron breaks into two intermediate mass nuclear fragments

on+92U—> 92U—> 56Ba+36Kr+30n (13.26)

The same reaction can produce other pairs of intermediate mass
fragments

gn+2§§U —> 2§§U —> 1§§Sb+ Z?Nb+4gn (13.27)
Or, as another example,
gn+ 2g§U —> 132x“ §§Sr + 2 am (13.28)

The fragment products are radioactive nuclei; they emit [3 particles in
succession to achieve stable end products.

The energy released (the Qvalue ) in the fission reaction of nuclei like
uranium is of the order of 200 MeV per fissioning nucleus. This is
estimated as follows:

Let us take a nucleus with A = 240 breaking into two fragments each
ofA = 120. Then

Elm for A = 240 nucleus is about 7.6 MeV,
Elm for the two A = 120 fragment nuclei is about 8.5 MeV.
Gain in binding energy for nucleon is about 0.9 MeV.

Hence the total gain in binding energy is 24OXO.9 or 2 16 MeV.

The disintegration energy in fission events first appears as the kinetic
energy of the fragments and neutrons. Eventually it is transferred to the
surrounding matter appearing as heat. The source of energy in nuclear
reactors, which produce electricity, is nuclear fission. The enormous
energy released in an atom bomb comes from uncontrolled nuclear ﬁssion.
We discuss some details in the next section how a nuclear reactor
functions.

13.7.2 Nuclear reactor

Notice one fact of great importance in the fission reactions given in Eqs.
(13.26) to (13.28). There is a release of extra neutron (s) in the fission
process. Averagely, 21/2 neutrons are released per fission of uranium
nucleus. It is a fraction since in some fission events 2 neutrons are
