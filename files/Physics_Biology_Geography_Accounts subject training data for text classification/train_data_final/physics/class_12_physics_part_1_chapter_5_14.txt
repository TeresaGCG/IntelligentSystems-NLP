0°41’ E at Delhi and 0°58’ W at Mumbai. Thus, at both these places a
magnetic needle shows the true north quite accurately.

There is one more quantity of interest. If a magnetic needle is perfectly
balanced about a horizontal aXis so that it can swing in a plane of the
magnetic meridian, the needle would make an angle with the horizontal
(Fig. 5.10). This is known as the angle of dip (also known as inclination).
Thus, dip is the angle that the total magnetic field BE of the earth makes
with the surface of the earth. Figure 5.1 1 shows the magnetic meridian
plane at a point P on the surface of the earth. The plane is a section through
the earth. The total magnetic field at P
can be resolved into a horizontal
component HE and a vertical
component ZE. The angle that BE makes
with HE is the angle of dip, I.

In most of the northern hemisphere, the north pole of the dip needle
tilts downwards. Likewise in most of the southern hemisphere, the south
pole of the dip needle tilts downwards.

To describe the magnetic field of the earth at a point on its surface, we
need to specify three quantities, viz., the declination D, the angle of dip or
the inclination I and the horizontal component of the earth’s field HE. These
are known as the element of the earth’s magnetic field.

Representing the verticle component by ZE, we have

ZE = BE sinI [5.10(a)]
HE: BE cosI [5.10(b)]
which gives,
