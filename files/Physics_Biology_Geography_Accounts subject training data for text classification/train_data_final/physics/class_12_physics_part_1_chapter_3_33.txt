T’Current isEyva‘.t‘s”calar although we represent current with an arrow.

Cuigrenm dammit obey the law of vector addition. That current is a
scalég’iialsd‘follows from it's deﬁnition. The current I through an area
of cros“§«s€ction is given by the scalar product of two vectors:

1:” . AS

where j and AS are vectors.

Refer to V-I curves of a resistor and a diode as drawn in the text. A
resistor obeys Ohm’s law while a diode does not. The assertion that
V = IR is a statement of Ohm’s law is not true. This equation deﬁnes
resistance and it may be applied to all conducting devices whether
they obey Ohm’s law or not. The Ohm's law asserts that the plot of I
versus Vis linear i.e., R is independent of V.

Equation E = p j leads to another statement of Ohm’s law, i.e., a
conducting material obeys Ohm’s law when the resistivity of the
material does not depend on the magnitude and direction of applied
electric ﬁeld.

Homogeneous conductors like silver or semiconductors like pure
germanium or germanium containing impurities obey Ohm’s law
within some range of electric ﬁeld values. If the ﬁeld becomes too
strong. there are departures from Ohm’s law in all cases.

Motion of conduction electrons in electric ﬁeld E is the sum of (i)
motion due to random collisions and (ii) that due to E. The motion
