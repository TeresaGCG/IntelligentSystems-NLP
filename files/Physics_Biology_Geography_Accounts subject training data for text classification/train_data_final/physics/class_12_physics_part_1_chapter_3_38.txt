(c) Is the balance point affected by this high resistance?

(d) Would the method work in the above situation if the driver cell
of the potentiometer had an emf of 1.0V instead of 2.0V?

(e) Would the circuit work well for determining an extremely small
emf, say of the order of a few mV (such as the typical emf of a
thermo-couple)? If not, how will you modify the circuit?

Figure 3.34 shows a 2.0 V potentiometer used for the determination
of internal resistance of a 1.5 V cell. The balance point of the cell in
open circuit is 76.3 cm. When a resistor of 9.5 Q is used in the external
circuit of the cell, the balance point shifts to 64.8 cm length of the
potentiometer wire. Determine the internal resistance of the cell.
