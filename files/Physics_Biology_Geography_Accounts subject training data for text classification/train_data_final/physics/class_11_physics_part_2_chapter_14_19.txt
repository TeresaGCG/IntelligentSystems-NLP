The frequency v of periodic or oscillatory motion is the number of oscillations per
unit time. In the SI, it is measured in hertz :

1 hertz = 1 Hz = 1 oscillation per second = 1s‘1

In simple harmonic motion [SHM], the displacement x (t) of a particle from its
equilibrium position is given by,

x (t) = A cos (cot + q) ) (displacement),

in which A is the amplitude of the displacement, the quantity (cot + (1)] is the phase of
the motion, and q) is the phase constant. The angular frequency a) is related to the
period and frequency of the motion by,

a) = ? = 27W (angular frequency].

Simple harmonic motion can also be viewed as the projection of uniform circular
motion on the diameter of the circle in which the latter motion occurs.

The particle velocity and acceleration during SHM as functions of time are given by,
v (t) = —mA sin (cot + (p) (velocity),
a (t) = —w2A cos [cot + (1)]

= —(o2x [t] [acceleration],

Thus we see that both velocity and acceleration of a body executing simple harmonic
motion are periodic functions, having the velocity amplitude vm=coA and acceleration
amplitude am =co 2A, respectively.

The force acting in a simple harmonic motion is proportional to the displacement and
is always directed towards the centre of motion.

A particle executing simple harmonic motion has, at any time, kinetic energy
K = 1/2 va and potential energy U = 1/2 W. If no friction is present the mechanical
energy of the system, E = K + U always remains constant even though K and U change
with time.

A particle of mass m oscillating under the inﬂuence of Hooke’s law restoring force
given by F = — k x exhibits simple harmonic motion with

a) = — (angular frequency)

T : 275E [period]

Such a system is also called a linear oscillator.

The motion of a simple pendulum swinging through small angles is approximately
simple harmonic. The period of oscillation is given by,

T=27£\/E
g

The mechanical energy in a real oscillating system decreases during oscillations because
external forces, such as drag, inhibit the oscillations and transfer mechanical energy
to thermal energy. The real oscillator and its motion are then said to be damped. If the
