15.26 Earthquakes generate sound waves inside the earth. Unlike a gas, the earth can
experience both transverse [S] and longitudinal [P] sound waves. Typically the speed
of S wave is about 4.0 km 54, and that of P wave is 8.0 km s’l. A seismograph
records Pand Swaves from an earthquake. The first Pwave arrives 4 min before the
first S wave. Assuming the waves travel in straight line, at what distance does the
earthquake occur ?

15.27 A bat is ﬂitting about in a cave, navigating via ultrasonic beeps. Assume that the
sound emission frequency of the bat is 40 kHz. During one fast swoop directly
toward a ﬂat wall surface, the bat is moving at 0.03 times the speed of sound in air.
What frequency does the bat hear reﬂected off the wall ?
