10.5. 1 Stokes' Law

When a body falls through a ﬂuid it drags the
layer of the ﬂuid in contact with it. A relative
motion between the different layers of the ﬂuid
is set and, as a result, the body experiences a
retarding force. Falling of a raindrop and
swinging of a pendulum bob are some common
examples of such motion. It is seen that the
viscous force is proportional to the velocity of
the object and is opposite to the direction of
motion. The other quantities on which the force
Fdepends are viscosity 1] of the ﬂuid and radius
a of the sphere. Sir George G. Stokes (1819—
1903), an English scientist enunciated clearly
the viscous drag force F as

F=67t77av (10.19)

This is known as Stokes’ law. We shall not
derive Stokes’ law.

This law is an interesting example of retarding
force, which is proportional to velocity. We can
study its consequences on an object falling
through a viscous medium. We consider a
raindrop in air. It accelerates initially due to
gravity. As the velocity increases, the retarding
force also increases. Finally, when viscous force
plus buoyant force becomes equal to the force
due to gravity, the net force becomes zero and so
does the acceleration. The sphere (raindrop) then
descends with a constant velocity. Thus, in
equilibrium, this terminal velocity vt is given by

67mm)t = (475/ 3) a3 (9-0)!)

where p and o are mass densities of sphere and
the ﬂuid, respectively. We obtain

v. = 2a2 (9-619 / (911) (1020}

So the terminal velocity vt depends on the
square of the radius of the sphere and inversely
on the viscosity of the medium.

You may like to refer back to Example 6.2 in
this context.

Example 1 0.1 O The terminal velocity of a
copper ball of radius 2.0 mm falling through
a tank of oil at 20"C is 6.5 cm 5". Compute

the viscosity of the oil at 20°C. Density of
oil is 1.5 ><103 kg m"’. density of copper is
8.9 x 1015 kg m“.

 

AnswerWe have vt= 6.5 x 10'2 mS'1,a= 2 x 10'3 m,
g = 9.8 mS'Z, p = 8.9 x 103 kg m'3,

10.6 SURFACE TENSION

You must have noticed that, oil and water do
not mix; water wets you and me but not ducks;
mercury does not wet glass but water sticks to
it, oil rises up a cotton wick, inspite of gravity,
Sap and water rise up to the top of the leaves of
the tree, hair of a paint brush do not cling
together when dry and even when dipped in
water but form a fine tip when taken out of it.
All these and many more such experiences are
related with the free surfaces of liquids. As
liquids have no definite shape but have a
definite volume, they acquire a free surface when
poured in a container. These surfaces possess
some additional energy. This phenomenon is
known as surface tension and it is concerned
with only liquid as gases do not have free
surfaces. Let us now understand this
phenomena.
