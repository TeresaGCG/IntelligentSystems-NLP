Example 6.7

A wheel with 10 metallic spokes each 0.5 m long is rotated with a
speed of 120 rev/min in a plane normal to the horizontal component
of earth’s magnetic field HE at a place. If HE = 0.4 G at the place, what
is the induced emf between the axle and the rim of the wheel? Note
that 1 G = 10‘4T.

Solution
Induced emf = (1/2) (9B R2

= (1/2) x 41: x 0.4 x 10—4 x (0.5)2
= 6.28 x 10—5v

The number of spokes is immaterial because the emf‘s across the
spokes are in parallel.

6.7 ENERGY CONSIDERATION: A QUANTITATIVE STUDY

In Section 6.5, we discussed qualitatively that Lenz’s law is consistent with
the law of conservation of energy. Now we shall explore this aspect further
with a concrete example.

Let rbe the resistance of movable arm P9 of the rectangular conductor
shown in Fig. 6.10. We assume that the remaining arms QR, RS and SP
have negligible resistances compared to r. Thus, the overall resistance of
the rectangular loop is r and this does not change as P9 is moved. The

current I in the loop is,

On account of the presence of the magnetic ﬁeld, there will be a force
on the arm PQ. This force I (1 x B), is directed outwards in the direction
opposite to the velocity of the rod. The magnitude of this force is,

F = I lB = r
where we have used Eq. (6.7). Note that this force arises due to drift velocity
of charges (responsible for current) along the rod and the consequent
Lorentz force acting on them.

Alternatively, the arm P9 is being pushed with a constant speed 0,
the power required to do this is,

The agent that does this work is mechanical. Where does this
mechanical energy go? The answer is: it is dissipated as Joule heat, and
