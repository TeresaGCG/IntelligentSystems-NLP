UNITS AND MEASUREMENT

zeroes appearing in the base number in the
scientific notation are signiﬁcant. Each number
in this case has four significant figures.

Thus, in the scientific notation, no confusion
arises about the trailing zero(s) in the base
number a. They are always significant.

(4) The scientific notation is ideal for reporting
measurement. But if this is not adopted, we use
the rules adopted in the preceding example :

' For a number greater than 1, without any
decimal, the trailing zero(s) are not
significant.

' For a number with a decimal, the trailing
zero(s) are significant.

(5) The digit 0 conventionally put on the left of a
decimal for a number less than 1 (like 0.1250)
is never significant. However, the zeroes at the
end of such number are significant in a
measurement.

(6) The multiplying or dividing factors which are
neither rounded numbers nor numbers
representing measured values are exact and
have infinite number of significant digits. For

example in T=E or s = 27cr, the factor 2 is an

exact number and it can be written as 2.0, 2.00

t
or 2.0000 as required. Similarly, in ng’ n is

an exact number.

2.7. 1 Rules for Arithmetic Operations with
Signiﬁcant Figures

The result of a calculation involving approximate
measured values of quantities (i.e. values with
limited number of significant ﬁgures) must reﬂect
the uncertainties in the original measured values.
It cannot be more accurate than the original
measured values themselves on which the result
is based. In general, the final result should not
have more significant figures than the original
data from which it was obtained. Thus, if mass of
an object is measured to be, say, 4.237 g (four
significant figures) and its volume is measured to
be 2.5 1 cm3, then its density, by mere arithmetic
division, is 1 .6880478087 6 g/cm3 upto 1 1 decimal
places. It would be clearly absurd and irrelevant
to record the calculated value of density to such a
precision when the measurements on which the
value is based, have much less precision. The

following rules for arithmetic operations with
signiﬁcant figures ensure that the final result of
a calculation is shown with the precision that is
consistent with the precision of the input
measured values :
(1) In multiplication or division, the final
result should retain as many significant
figures as are there in the original number
with the least significant figures.

Thus, in the example above, density should
be reported to three significant figures.

4.237g
Density 2
2.51 cm

3 = 1.69 g cm'3

Similarly, if the speed of light is given as
3 x 108 m s1 (one significant figure) and one
year (1y = 365.25 d) has 3.1557 x 107 s (ﬁve
signiﬁcant figures), the light year is 9.47 x 1015 m
(three significant figures).

(2) In addition or subtraction, the final result
should retain as many decimal places as are
there in the number with the least decimal
places.

For example, the sum of the numbers
436.32 g, 227.2 g and 0.301 g by mere arithmetic
addition, is 663.821 g. But the least precise
measurement (227 .2 g) is correct to only one
decimal place. The final result should, therefore,
be rounded off to 663.8 g.

Similarly, the difference in length can be
expressed as :

0.307 m — 0.304 m = 0.003 m = 3 X 10‘3 m.

Note that we should not use the rule (1)
applicable for multiplication and division and
write 664 g as the result in the example of
addition and 3.00 x 10'3 m in the example of
subtraction. They do not convey the precision
of measurement properly. For addition and
subtraction, the rule is in terms of decimal
places.

2.7.2 Rounding off the Uncertain Digits

The result of computation with approximate
numbers, which contain more than one
uncertain digit, should be rounded off. The rules
for rounding off numbers to the appropriate
significant figures are obvious in most cases. A
number 2.746 rounded off to three significant
figures is 2.75, while the number 2.743 would
be 2.74. The rule by convention is that the
preceding digit is raised by 1 if the
