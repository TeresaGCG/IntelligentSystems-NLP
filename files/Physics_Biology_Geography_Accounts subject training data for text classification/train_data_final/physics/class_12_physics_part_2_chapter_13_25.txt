used in archaeology. Suppose a specimen from Mohenjodaro gives
an activity of 9 decays per minute per gram of carbon. Estimate the
approximate age of the Indus-Valley civilisation.

Obtain the amount of 32 Co necessary to provide a radioactive source

of 8.0 mCi strength. The half-life of 33 C0 is 5.3 years.

The half-life of 2251' is 28 years. What is the disintegration rate of
15 mg of this isotope?
Obtain approximately the ratio of the nuclear radii of the gold isotope

1% Au and the silver isotope 12; Ag'

Find the Q-value and the kinetic energy of the emitted a—particle in

the a—decay of (a) 23:12.91 and (b) 282an.

Given m (ZggRa) = 22602540 u, m (282an) = 222.01750 u,
m (252%) = 220.01137 u, m(281fPo) = 216.00189 u.

The radionuclide 11C decays according to

161C —>1é B+e++vz TU2=20.3 min

The maximum energy of the emitted positron is 0.960 MeV.
Given the mass values:

m(161C)= 11.011434 u and m(1;B) = 11.009305 u,

calculate Q and compare it with the maximum energy of the positron
emitted.

The nucleus nge decays by [T emission. Write down the ﬁ-decay
equation and determine the maximum kinetic energy of the
electrons emitted. Given that:

m nge) = 22.994466 u

m (ﬁlNa) = 22.089770 u.

The Q value of a nuclear reaction A + b —> C + d is defined by
Q= [ mA+ mb— mC— deCZ
where the masses refer to the respective nuclei. Determine from the
given data the Q-value of the following reactions and state whether

the reactions are exothermic or endothermic.
(i) iH+fH —>12 H+fH

(ii) 1§C+1§C —>f§ Ne+§He

Atomic masses are given to be

m (12H) = 2.014102 u

m (?H) = 3.016049 u

m (130) = 12.000000 u
m(123Ne) = 19.992439 u

Suppose, we think of fission of a SgFe nucleus into two equal
fragments, 3A1 Is the fission energetically possible? Argue by
working out Q of the process. Given m (SgFe) = 55.93494 u and
m (fSAl) = 27.98191 u.
