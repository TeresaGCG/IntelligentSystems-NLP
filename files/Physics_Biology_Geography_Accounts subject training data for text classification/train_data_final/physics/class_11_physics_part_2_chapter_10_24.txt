10.19 What is the pressure inside the drop of mercury of radius 3.00 mm at room
temperature ? Surface tension of mercury at that temperature [20 °C) is 4.65 x
10'1 N m'l. The atmospheric pressure is 1.0 1 X 105 Pa. Also give the excess pressure
inside the drop.

10.20 What is the excess pressure inside a bubble of soap solution of radius 5.00 mm,
given that the surface tension of soap solution at the temperature [20 °C) is 2.50 x
10'2 N m"1 ? If an air bubble of the same dimension were formed at depth of 40.0
cm inside a container containing the soap solution [of relative density 1.20}. what
would be the pressure inside the bubble ? (1 atmospheric pressure is 1.0 1 x 105 Pa).

10.21 A tank with a square base of area 1.0 m2 is divided by a vertical partition in the
middle. The bottom of the partition has a small—hinged door of area 20 cm2. The
tank is filled with water in one compartment, and an acid (of relative density 1.7) in
the other. both to a height of 4.0 m. compute the force necessary to keep the door
close.

10.22 A manometer reads the pressure of a gas in an enclosure as shown in Fig. 10.25 (a)
When a pump removes some of the gas. the manometer reads as in Fig. 10.25 (b)
The liquid used in the manometers is mercury and the atmospheric pressure is 76
cm of mercury.

(a) Give the absolute and gauge pressure of the gas in the enclosure for cases (a)
and [b], in units of cm of mercury.

(b) How would the levels change in case (b) if 13.6 cm of water (immiscible with
mercury) are poured into the right limb of the manometer ? (Ignore the small
change in the volume of the gas).

10.23 Two vessels have the same base area but different shapes. The first vessel takes
twice the volume of water that the second vessel requires to fill upto a particular
common height. Is the force exerted by the water on the base of the vessel the same
in the two cases ? If so. why do the vessels filled with water to that same height give
different readings on a weighing scale ?
