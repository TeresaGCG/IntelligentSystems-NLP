2. 14 COMBINATION OF CAPACITORS
We can combine several capacitors of capacitance Cl, C2, . . ., C11 to obtain
a system with some effective capacitance C. The effective capacitance
depends on the way the individual capacitors are combined. Two simple
possibilities are discussed below.
2.14. 1 Capacitors in series
Figure 2.26 shows capacitors C1 and C2 combined in series.
The left plate of C1 and the right plate of C2 are connected to two
terminals of a battery and have charges Q and —Q ,
respectively. It then follows that the right plate of C1
9 ' Q Q _ Q has charge —Q and the left plate of C2 has charge Q.
+ _ + _ If this was not so, the net charge on each capacitor
+ — + - would not be zero. This would result in an electric
+ - + — ﬁeld in the conductor connecting Cland C2. Charge
+ _ + — would ﬂow until the net charge on both C1 and C2
+ — + _ is zero and there is no electric ﬁeld in the conductor
+ - + - connecting C1 and Oz. Thus, in the series
+ Z + : combination, charges on the two plates (iQ) are the
+ + same on each capacitor. The total potential drop V
C, C2 across the combination is the sum of the potential
drops V1 and V2 across C1 and Cg, respectively.
