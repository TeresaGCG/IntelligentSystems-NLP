ll.

damping force is given by F d = —bv, where v is the velocity of the oscillator and b is a
damping constant, then the displacement of the oscillator is given by,

x (t) = Ae-bt/Zm cos [w’t + ¢)

where (0’, the angular frequency of the damped oscillator, is given by

b2

m_24m

If the damping constant is small then (o’z (o, where co is the angular frequency of the
undamped oscillator. The mechanical energy E of the damped oscillator is given by

E(t) = ékAze'bt/m

If an external force with angular frequency (0d acts on an oscillating system with natural
angular frequency a), the system oscillates with angular frequency (0d. The amplitude of
oscillations is the greatest when

POINTS TO PONDER

 

The period T is the (cast time after which motion repeats itself. Thus. motion repeats
itself after nT where n is an integer.

Every periodic motion is not simple hamionic motion. Only that periodic motion
governed by the force law F = — kx is simple harmonic.

Circular motion can arise due to an inverse~square law force (as in planetary motion)
as well as due to simple harmonic force in two dimensions equal to: —mar”r. In the
latter case. the phases of motion, in two perpendicular directions (x and y] must differ
by TE/2. Thus. for example, a particle subject to a force —m(02r with initial position (0.
A) and velocity [coA. 0) will move uniformly in a circle of radius A.

For linear simple harmonic motion with a given a). two initial conditions are necessary
and sufficient to determine the motion completely. The initial conditions may be (i)
initial position and initial velocity or (ii) amplitude and phase or (iii) energy
and phase.
