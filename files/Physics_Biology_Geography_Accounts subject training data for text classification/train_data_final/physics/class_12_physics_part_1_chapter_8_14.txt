8.4.6 X-rays

Beyond the UV region of the electromagnetic spectrum lies the X-ray
region. We are familiar with X—rays because of its medical applications. It
covers wavelengths from about 10”8 m (10 nm) down to 10‘13 m
(1041 nm). One common way to generate X-rays is to bombard a metal
target by high energy electrons. X—rays are used as a diagnostic tool in
medicine and as a treatment for certain forms of cancer. Because X-rays
damage or destroy living tissues and organisms, care must be taken to
avoid unnecessary or over exposure.

8.4.7 Gamma rays

They lie in the upper frequency range of the electromagnetic spectrum
and have wavelengths of from about lO‘lOm to less than 10—14m. This
high frequency radiation is produced in nuclear reactions and
also emitted by radioactive nuclei. They are used in medicine to destroy
cancer cells.

Table 8.1 summarises different types of electromagnetic waves, their
production and detections. As mentioned earlier, the demarcation
between different regions is not sharp and there are overlaps.
