spheres. When the separation between two spheres is much
larger than the radius of each sphere, the charged spheres
may be regarded as point charges. However, the charges
on the spheres were unknown, to begin with. How then
could he discover a relation like Eq. (1 . 1)? Coulomb
thought of the following simple way: Suppose the charge
on a metallic sphere is q. If the sphere is put in contact
with an identical uncharged sphere, the charge will spread
over the two spheres. By symmetry, the charge on each
sphere will be q/ 2*. Repeating this process, we can get
charges q/ 2, q/ 4, etc. Coulomb varied the distance for a
ﬁxed pair of charges and measured the force for different
separations. He then varied the charges in pairs, keeping
the distance fixed for each pair. Comparing forces for
different pairs of charges at different distances, Coulomb
arrived at the relation, Eq. (1.1).

Coulomb’s law, a simple mathematical statement,
was initially experimentally arrived at in the manner
described above. While the original experiments
established it at a macroscopic scale, it has also been
established down to subatomic level (r ~ 10‘10 m).

Coulomb discovered his law without knowing the
explicit magnitude of the charge. In fact, it is the other
way round: Coulomb’s law can now be employed to
furnish a definition for a unit of charge. In the relation,
Eq. (1.1), kis so far arbitrary. We can choose any positive
value of k. The choice of k determines the size of the unit
of charge. In SI units, the value of k is about 9 X 109
Nm2

C2
called a coulomb which we defined earlier in Section
1.4. Putting this value of k in Eq. (1.1), we see that for
q1=q2=1C,r=1m

F: 9 x 109 N

That is, 1 C is the charge that when placed at a
distance of 1 m from another charge of the same
magnitude in vacuum experiences an electrical force of
repulsion of magnitude 9 X 109 N. One coulomb is
evidently too big a unit to be used. In practice, in

electrostatics, one uses smaller units like 1 mC or 1 “C.
The constant k in Eq. (1.1) is usually put as

 

. The unit of charge that results from this choice is

Charles Augustin de
Coulomb (1736 - 1806)
Coulomb, a French
physicist, began his career
as a military engineer in
the West Indies. In 1776, he
returned to Paris and
retired to a small estate to
do his scientific research.
He invented a torsion
balance to measure the
quantity of a force and used
it for determination of
forces of electric attraction
or repulsion between small
charged spheres. He thus
arrived in 1785 at the
inverse square law relation,
now known as Coulomb’s
law. The law had been
anticipated by Priestley and
also by Cavendish earlier,
though Cavendish never
published his results.
Coulomb also found the
inverse square law of force
between unlike and like
magnetic poles.

k = 1 /47580 for later convenience, so that Coulomb’s law is written as

1 |q1q2|

47:80 r2

 

F:

(1.2)

so is called the permittivity of free space . The value of 80 in SI units is

80 = 8.854 x 10—12 c2 N‘lm‘2

* Implicit in this is the assumption of additivity of Charges and conservation:

two charges (q/ 2 each) add up to make a total charge q.
