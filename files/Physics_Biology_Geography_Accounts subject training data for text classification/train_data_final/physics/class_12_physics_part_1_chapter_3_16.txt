Exactly as before
I: I1 + I2 + I3 (3.46)
and applying Ohm’s law to R1, R2 and R3 we get,
V=11R1, V=I2 R2, V=13R3 (3.47)
So that
I=Il+12+13=V[i+i+i] (3.48)

An equivalent resistance Req that replaces the combination, would be
such that

and hence

We can reason similarly for any number of resistors in parallel. The
equivalent resistance of n resistors R1, R2 . . . ,R11 is

These formulae for equivalent resistances can be used to ﬁnd out
currents and voltages in more complicated circuits. Consider for example,
the circuit in Fig. (3.17), where there are three resistors R1, R2 and R3.
R2 and R3 are in parallel and hence we can
replace them by an equivalent R2: between

The circuit now has R1 and R3: in series
and hence their combination can be = ._>I_/vvvvv\_>_.

If the voltage between A and C is V, the
