a circle with a centre C on the axis. The radius
of the circle is r, the perpendicular distance of
the point P from the axis. We also show the
linear velocity vector v of the particle at P. It is
along the tangent at P to the circle.

Let P’ be the position of the particle after an
interval of time At (Fig. 7.16). The angle PCP’
describes the angular displacement A0 of the
particle in time At. The average angular velocity
of the particle over the interval At is AO/ At. As
At tends to zero (i.e. takes smaller and smaller
values), the ratio AO/ At approaches a limit which
is the instantaneous angular velocity d6/dt of
the particle at the position P. We denote the
instantaneous angular velocity by a) (the
Greek letter omega). We know from our study
of circular motion that the magnitude of linear
velocity v of a particle moving in a circle is
related to the angular velocity of the particle 60
by the simple relation 1) = wr, where r is the
radius of the circle.

We observe that at any given instant the
relation v = (0T applies to all particles of the
rigid body. Thus for a particle at a perpendicular
distance ri from the fixed axis, the linear velocity
at a given instant vi is given by

vi = curl. (7.19)

The index iruns from 1 to n, where n is the
total number of particles of the body.

For particles on the axis, r = 0 , and hence

v = a) r = 0. Thus, particles on the axis are
stationary. This verifies that the axis is ﬁxed.

Note that we use the same angular velocity
u) for all the particles. We therefore, refer to (o
as the angular velocity of the whole body.

We have characterised pure translation of
a body by all parts of the body having the same
velocity at any instant of time. Similarly, we
may characterise pure rotation by all parts of
the body having the same angular velocity at
any instant of time. Note that this
characterisation of the rotation of a rigid body
about a fixed axis is just another way of saying
as in Sec. 7. 1 that each particle of the body moves
in a circle, which lies in a plane perpendicular
to the axis and has the centre on the axis.

In our discussion so far the angular velocity
appears to be a scalar. In fact, it is a vector. We
shall not justify this fact, but we shall accept
it. For rotation about a fixed axis, the angular
velocity vector lies along the axis of rotation,

and points out in the direction in which a right
handed screw would advance, if the head of the
screw is rotated with the body. (See Fig. 7 . 17a).

The magnitude of this vector is a): dQ/dt
referred as above.

 

Fig. 7.17 (a) If the head of a right handed screw
rotates with the body, the screw
advances in the direction of the angular
velocity u). If the sense (clockwise or
anticlockwise) of rotation of the body
changes, so does the direction of a).

 

Fig. 7.1 7 (b) The angular velocity vector on is
directed along the ﬁxed axis as shown.
The linear velocity of the particle at P
is v = a) x r. It is perpendicular to both
a) and r and is directed along the
tangent to the circle described by the

particle.

We shall now look at what the vector product
a) x r corresponds to. Refer to Fig. 7 . 17 (b) which
is a part of Fig. 7.16 reproduced to show the
path of the particle P. The figure shows the
vector a) directed along the fixed (2—) axis and

also the position vector r = op of the particle

at P of the rigid body with respect to the origin
0. Note that the origin is chosen to be on the
axis of rotation.
