Solution

(a) Wrong. Magnetic ﬁeld lines can never emanate from a point, as
shown in ﬁgure. Over any closed surface, the net ﬂux of B must
always be zero, i.e., pictorially as many field lines should seem to
enter the surface as the number of lines leaving it. The field lines
shown, in fact, represent electric field of a long positively charged
wire. The correct magnetic field lines are circling the straight
conductor, as described in Chapter 4.
