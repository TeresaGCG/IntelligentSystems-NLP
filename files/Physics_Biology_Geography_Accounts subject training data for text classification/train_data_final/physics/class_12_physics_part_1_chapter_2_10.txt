2.6. 1 Relation between ﬁeld and potential

Consider two closely spaced equipotential surfaces A and B (Fig. 2.12)
with potential values Vand V + 6V, where 6Vis the change in Vin the
direction of the electric field E. Let P be a point on the
surface B. 6 l is the perpendicular distance of the
surface A from P. Imagine that a unit positive charge
is moved along this perpendicular from the surface B
to surface A against the electric ﬁeld. The work done
in this process is | E | El.
This work equals the potential difference
VA—VB.
Thus,

|E|6l=V—(V+ 6V)=—5V

i.e., |E|=—5—V (2.20)

Equipotentials
Since 6V is negative, 6V = — |6V|. we can rewrite
Eq (2.20) as

6V |6V|
E : —— : +—
| | 61 61 (2.21)

We thus arrive at two important conclusions concerning the relation

between electric ﬁeld and potential:

(i) Electric field is in the direction in which the potential decreases
steepest.

(ii) Its magnitude is given by the change in the magnitude of potential
per unit displacement normal to the equipotential surface at the point.

2.7 POTENTIAL ENERGY OF A SYSTEM OF CHARGES

Consider ﬁrst the simple case of two charges qland q2 with position vector
r1 and 1'2 relative to some origin. Let us calculate the work done
(externally) in building up this configuration. This means that we consider
the charges q1 and q2 initially at inﬁnity and determine the work done by
an external agency to bring the charges to the given locations. Suppose,
ﬁrst the charge q1 is brought from inﬁnity to the point r1. There is no
external ﬁeld against which work needs to be done, so work done in
bringing q1 from inﬁnity to r1 is zero. This charge produces a potential in
space given by

From the definition of potential, work done in bringing charge q2 from
infinity to the point 1'2 is q2 times the potential at 1'2 due to qlz
