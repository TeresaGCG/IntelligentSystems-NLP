EXAMPLE 7.4

 

 

Example 7.3 A lamp is connected in series with a capacitor. Predict
your observations for do and ac connections. What happens in each
case if the capacitance of the capacitor is reduced?

Solution When a dc source is connected to a capacitor. the capacitor
gets charged and after charging no current ﬂows in the circuit and

the lamp will not glow. There will be no change even if C is reduced.
With ac source. the capacitor offers capacitative reactance (l/(DC)
and the current ﬂows in the circuit. Consequently. the lamp will shine.
Reducing C will increase reactance and the lamp will shine less brightly
than before.

 

Example 7.4 A 15.0 tlF capacitor is connected to a 220 V. 50 HZ source.
Find the capacitive reactance and the current (rms and peak) in the
circuit. If the frequency is doubled. What happens to the capacitive
reactance and the current?

Solution The capacitive reactance is
