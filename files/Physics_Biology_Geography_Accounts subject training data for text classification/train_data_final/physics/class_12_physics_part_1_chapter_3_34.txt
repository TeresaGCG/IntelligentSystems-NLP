due to random collisions averages to zero and does not contribute to
vd [Chapter 1 1, Textbook of Class XI). vd , thus is only due to applied
electric field on the electron.

5. The relation j = p v should be applied to each type of charge carriers
separately. In a conducting wire, the total current and charge density
arises from both positive and negative charges:

1' = I). V. + p_ v_
P = P». + P,
Now in a neutral wire carrying electric current,

p+ = _ p.

Further, v+ ~ 0 which gives
P = 0

J' = p. v

Thus, the relation j = p v does not apply to the total current charge
density.

6. Kirchhoff‘s junction rule is based on conservation of charge and the
outgoing currents add up and are equal to incoming current at a
junction. Bending or reorienting the wire does not change the validity
of Kirchhoffs junction rule.
