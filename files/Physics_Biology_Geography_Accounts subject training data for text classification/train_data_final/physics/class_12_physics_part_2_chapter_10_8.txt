You have already encountered Doppler effect for sound waves in
Chapter 15 of Class XI textbook. For velocities small compared to the
speed of light, we can use the same formulae which we use for sound
waves. The fractional change in frequency Av/v is given by —vr81 di 81 / c, where
vradial is the component of the source velocity along the line joining the
observer to the source relative to the observer; vra di 81 is considered positive
when the source moves away from the observer. Thus, the Doppler shift
can be expressed as:

AV _ Uradial

V C

 

(10.9)

The formula given above is valid only when the speed of the source is
small compared to that of light. A more accurate formula for the Doppler
effect which is valid even when the speeds are close to that of light, requires
the use of Einstein’s special theory of relativity. The Doppler effect for
light is very important in astronomy. It is the basis for the measurements
of the radial velocities of distant galaxies.

Example 10.1 What speed should a galaxy move with respect
to us so that the sodium line at 589.0 nm is observed
at 589.6 nm?

Av A)»

Solution Since vi = c, 7 = *7 (for small changes in v and A). For

A?» = 589.6 — 589.0 = + 0.6 nm
we get [using Eq. (10.9)]

V 2. c
~ 0.6 _ 5 _1
or, vradial =+€£589.0)_+3’06X10 ms

= 306 km/s
Therefore, the galaxy is moving away from us.

Example 10.2

(a) When monochromatic light is incident on a surface separating
two media, the reﬂected and refracted light both have the same
frequency as the incident frequency. Explain why?

(b) When light travels from a rarer to a denser medium, the speed
decreases. Does the reduction in speed imply a reduction in the
energy carried by the light wave?

(c) In the wave picture of light, intensity of light is determined by the
square of the amplitude of the wave. What determines the intensity
of light in the photon picture of light.

Solution
(a) Reﬂection and refraction arise through interaction of incident light
with the atomic constituents of matter. Atoms may be viewed as
