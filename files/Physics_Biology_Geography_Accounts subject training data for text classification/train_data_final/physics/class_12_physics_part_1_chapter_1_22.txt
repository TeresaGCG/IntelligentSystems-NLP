Electric Charges
and Fields

The electric field vector E1B at B due to the positive charge q1 points
towards the left and has a magnitude
_ (9 xiogNm2c-2) >< (1045C) _

The electric field vector E2B at B due to the negative charge q2 points
towards the right and has a magnitude

(9 x 109Nm2C'2)><(10‘8C) _
E2B = —2 _
(0.15m)

The magnitude of the total electric field at B is

EB = EIB — E2B = 3.2 x 104 N 0‘1

EB is directed towards the left.

The magnitude of each electric field vector at point C, due to charge
q1 and q2 is

4 x 103 NC‘1

_ (9 x lOQNmZC‘2)><(10_8C) =
_ (0.10m)2

The directions in which these two vectors point are indicated in
Fig. 1.14. The resultant of these two vectors is

E1C = E2C 9 x 103 N C‘1

EC=E1cos g+E2COS 3: 9X 103 NC’1

EC points towards the right.

1.9 ELECTRIC FIELD LINES

We have studied electric ﬁeld in the last section. It is a vector quantity
and can be represented as we represent vectors. Let us try to represent E
due to a point charge pictorially. Let the point charge be placed at the
origin. Draw vectors pointing along the direction of the electric field with
their lengths proportional to the strength of the field at

each point. Since the magnitude of electric ﬁeld at a point

decreases inversely as the square of the distance of that

point from the charge, the vector gets shorter as one goes \
away from the origin, always pointing radially outward.

Figure 1.15 shows such a picture. In this figure, each \

Connect the arrows pointing in one direction and the <— <— <—.—> —> —>

ﬁeld lines, all pointing outwards from the point charge.

Have we lost the information about the strength or /
magnitude of the ﬁeld now, because it was contained in /
the length of the arrow? No. Now the magnitude of the

ﬁeld is represented by the density of ﬁeld lines. E is strong

near the charge, so the density of field lines is more near

the ﬁeld gets weaker and the density of ﬁeld lines is less,
resulting in well-separated lines.

Another person may draw more lines. But the number of lines is not
important. In fact, an inﬁnite number of lines can be drawn in any region.
