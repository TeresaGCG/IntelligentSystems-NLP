Answer We choose the origin of the x—,and y-
axis at the edge of the cliff and t = O s at the
instant the stone is thrown. Choose the positive
direction of x—axis to be along the initial velocity
and the positive direction of y-axis to be the
vertically upward direction. The x—, and y-
components of the motion can be treated
independently. The equations of motion are :
x(t) =xo+voxt
y (t) = y0 + voy t+(l/2) ay t2
Here, x0 = y0 = 0,1)Dy = O, ay= —g = —9.8 m s2,
v0X = 15 m s‘l.
The stone hits the ground when y(t) = — 490 m.
— 490 m = —(1/2)(9.8) t2.
This gives t=lO s.
The velocity components are vx = vex and
vy = voy — g 1;
so that when the stone hits the ground :
vex = 15 m s‘1
voy=O—9.8>< lO=—98ms‘1
Therefore, the speed of the stone is

.(ui +vy2 =«/152 +982 =99m s‘1 4

 

b Example 4.9 A cricket ball is thrown at a
speed of 28 m 3’1 in a direction 30° above
the horizontal. Calculate (a) the maximum
height, (b) the time taken by the ball to
return to the same level. and (c) the
distance from the thrower to the point
where the ball returns to the same level.

 

Answer (a) The maximum height is given by
(v0 sint90)2 (28 sin 30°)2

 

m 29 2 (9.8)
'_ 14x14 _ 10 o
‘2x9.8‘ ' m

(b) The time taken to return to the same level is
Tf= (2 v0 sin 00)/g = (2X 28 X sin 30°)/9.8
= 28/98 s =2.9 s
(c) The distance from the thrower to the point
where the ball returns to the same level is

(US$200) _ 28 x 28 x sin 60°
9 9.8

Neglecting air resistance - what does
the assumption really mean?

While treating the topic of projectile motion.
we have stated that we assume that the
air resistance has no effect on the motion
of the projectile. You must understand what
the statement really means. Friction, force
due to viscosity, air resistance are all
dissipative forces. In the presence of any of
such forces opposing motion, any object will
lose some part of its initial energy and
consequently, momentum too. Thus, a
projectile that traverses a parabolic path
would certainly show deviation from its
idealised trajectory in the presence of air
resistance. It will not hit the ground with
the same speed with which it was projected
from it. In the absence of air resistance, the
x-component of the velocity remains
constant and it is only the y-component that
undergoes a continuous change. However.
in the presence of air resistance, both of
these would get affected. That would mean
that the range would be less than the one
given by Eq. (4.43). Maximum height
attained would also be less than that
predicted by Eq. (4.42). Can you then,
anticipate the change in the time of ﬂight?

In order to avoid air resistance. we will
have to perform the experiment in vacuum
or under low pressure, which is not easy.
When we use a phrase like ‘neglect air
resistance’. we imply that the change in
parameters such as range. height etc. is
much smaller than their values without air
resistance. The calculation without air
resistance is much simpler than that with
air resistance.

4. 1 1 UNIFORM CIRCULAR MOTION

When an object follows a circular path at a
constant speed, the motion of the object is called
uniform circular motion. The word “uniform”
refers to the speed, which is uniform (constant)
throughout the motion. Suppose an object is
moving with uniform speed 1) in a circle of radius
R as shown in Fig. 4. 19. Since the velocity of the
object is changing continuously in direction, the
object undergoes acceleration. Let us find the
magnitude and the direction of this acceleration.
