in MeV, is released if all the atoms in 1 kg of pure 94

13.18 A 1000 MW ﬁssion reactor consumes half of its fuel in 5.00 y. How
much ZSSU did it contain initially? Assume that the reactor operates
80% of the time, that all the energy generated arises from the fission

of ZSSU and that this nuclide is consumed only by the fission process.

13.19 How long can an electric lamp of 100W be kept glowing by fusion of
2.0 kg of deuterium? Take the fusion reaction as

21H+§H—> gHe +n+3.27 MeV

13.20 Calculate the height of the potential barrier for a head on collision
of two deuterons. (Hint: The height of the potential barrier is given
by the Coulomb repulsion between the two deuterons when they
just touch each other. Assume that they can be taken as hard
spheres of radius 2.0 fm.)

13.21 From the relation R = ROAl/s, where RO is a constant and A is the
mass number of a nucleus, show that the nuclear matter density is
nearly constant (i.e. independent of A).

13.22 For the [3+ (positron) emission from a nucleus, there is another
competing process known as electron capture (electron from an inner
orbit, say, the K—shell, is captured by the nucleus and a neutrino is
emitted).
e+ + 2X —> ZﬁY+ v

Show that if [3* emission is energetically allowed, electron capture
is necessarily allowed but not vice—versa.

13.23 In a periodic table the average atomic mass of magnesium is given
as 24.312 u. The average value is based on their relative natural

abundance on earth. The three isotopes and their masses are ﬁgMg
(23.98504u), ﬁgMg (24.98584u) and ﬁgMg (25.98259u). The natural

abundance of ZigMg is 78.99% by mass. Calculate the abundances
of other two isotopes.

13.24 The neutron separation energy is deﬁned as the energy required to
remove a neutron from the nucleus. Obtain the neutron separation

energies of the nuclei :éCa and 3A1 from the following data:
m(§36a) = 39.962591 u
m(§3Ca) = 40.962278 u
m(21§Al) = 25.986895 u
m(21;Al) = 26.981541 u

13.25 A source contains two phosphorous radio nuclides :I’EP (T1 /2 = 14.3d)

and “:‘gP(T1/2 = 25.3d). Initially, 10% of the decays come from E‘EP.
How long one must wait until 90% do so?

13.26 Under certain circumstances, a nucleus can decay by emitting a
particle more massive than an oc-particle. Consider the following
decay processes:
