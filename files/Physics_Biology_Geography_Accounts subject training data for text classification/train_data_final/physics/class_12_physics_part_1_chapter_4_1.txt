Moving Charges and

Magnetism

James Maxwell who then realised that light was electromagnetic waves.
Radio waves were discovered by Hertz, and produced by J .C.Bose and
G. Marconi by the end of the 19th century. A remarkable scientific and
technological progress took place in the 20th century. This was due to
our increased understanding of electromagnetism and the invention of
devices for production, ampliﬁcation, transmission and detection of

electromagnetic waves.

FIGURE 4.1 The magnetic field due to a straight long current—carrying
wire. The wire is perpendicular to the plane of the paper. A ring of
compass needles surrounds the wire. The orientation of the needles is
shown when (a) the current emerges out of the plane of the paper.

(b) the current moves into the plane of the paper. (c) The arrangement of
iron filings around the wire. The darkened ends of the needle represent
north poles. The effect of the earth‘s magnetic field is neglected.

In this chapter, we will see how magnetic field exerts
forces on moving charged particles, like electrons,
protons, and current-carrying wires. We shall also learn
how currents produce magnetic fields. We shall see how
particles can be accelerated to very high energies in a
cyclotron. We shall study how currents and voltages are
detected by a galvanometer.

In this and subsequent Chapter on magnetism,
we adopt the following convention: A current or a
ﬁeld (electric or magnetic) emerging out of the plane of the
paper is depicted by a dot (6)). A current or a field going
into the plane of the paper is depicted by a cross (69 )*.
Figures. 4.1(a) and 4. 1 (b) correspond to these two
situations, respectively.

4.2 MAGNETIC FORCE
4.2.1 Sources and ﬁelds

Before we introduce the concept of a magnetic ﬁeld B, we
shall recapitulate what we have learnt in Chapter 1 about
the electric field E. We have seen that the interaction
between two charges can be considered in two stages.
The charge Q, the source of the ﬁeld, produces an electric
field E, where

 

Hans Christian Oersted
(1777-1851) Danish
physicist and chemist,
professor at Copenhagen.
He observed that a
compass needle suffers a
deﬂection when placed
near a wire carrying an
electric current. This
discovery gave the first
empirical evidence of a
connection between electric
and magnetic phenomena.
