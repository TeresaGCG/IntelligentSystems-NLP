Example 1.7 Consider the charges q, q, and —q placed at the vertices
of an equilateral triangle, as shown in Fig. 1.10. What is the force on
each charge?

 

FIGURE 1. 10

Solution The forces acting on charge q at A due to charges q at B

and —q at C are F12 along BA and F13 along AC respectively, as shown

in Fig. 1.10. By the parallelogram law, the total force F1 on the charge

q at A is given by

F1 = F 1”} where i3 is a unit vector along BC.

The force of attraction or repulsion for each pair of charges has the

The total force F2 on charge q at B is thus F2 = F i' 2, where i2 is a
unit vector along AC.
