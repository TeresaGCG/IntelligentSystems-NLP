a steady value of 2.8 A. What is the steady temperature of the heating
element if the room temperature is 27.0 °C? Temperature coefﬁcient
of resistance of nichrome averaged over the temperature range
involved is 1.70 X 10’4 °C’1.

(a) In a meter bridge [Fig 3.27], the balance point is found to be at
39.5 cm from the end A, when the resistor Y is of 12.5 9.
Determine the resistance of X. Why are the connections between
resistors in a Wheatstone or meter bridge made of thick copper
strips?

(b) Determine the balance point of the bridge above if X and Y are
interchanged.

(c) What happens if the galvanometer and cell are interchanged at
the balance point of the bridge? Would the galvanometer show
any current?

A storage battery of emf 8.0 V and internal resistance 0.5 Q is being

charged by a 120 V dc supply using a series resistor of 15.5 Q. What

is the terminal voltage of the battery during charging? What is the
purpose of having a series resistor in the charging circuit?

In a potentiometer arrangement, a cell of emf 1.25 V gives a balance

point at 35.0 cm length of the wire. If the cell is replaced by another

cell and the balance point shifts to 63.0 cm, what is the emf of the
second cell?

The number density of free electrons in a copper conductor

estimated in Example 3.1 is 8.5 X 1028 m’s. How long does an electron

take to drift from one end of a wire 3.0 m long to its other end? The

area of cross-section of the wire is 2.0 X 10’6 m2 and it is carrying a

current of 3.0 A.

The earth’s surface has a negative surface charge density of 10’9 C
m’z. The potential difference of 400 kV between the top of the
atmosphere and the surface results (due to the low conductivity of
the lower atmosphere) in a current of only 1800 A over the entire
globe. If there were no mechanism of sustaining atmospheric electric
