(b) We can use Gauss’s law to find the total charge q inside the cube.
We have 4) = q/eO or q = $80. Therefore,

q = 1.05 x 8.854 x 10—12 c = 9.27 x 10‘12 c.

Example 1.12 An electric field is uniform, and in the positive x
direction for positive x, and uniform with the same magnitude but in
the negative x direction for negative x. It is given that E = 200 i N/ C
for x > O and E = —200 i N/C for x < O. A right circular cylinder of
length 20 cm and radius 5 cm has its centre at the origin and its axis
along the x-aXis so that one face is at x = +10 cm and the other is at
x = —10 cm (Fig. 1.28). (a) What is the net outward ﬂux through each
ﬂat face? (b) What is the ﬂux through the side of the cylinder?
(c) What is the net outward ﬂux through the cylinder? (d) What is the
net charge inside the cylinder?

Solution
(a) We can see from the figure that on the left face E and AS are
parallel. Therefore, the outward ﬂux is

¢L= E-AS = — 200 MS

= + 200 AS, since ioAS = — AS

= + 200 x 1: (0.05)2 = + 1.57 N m2 0*1

On the right face, E and AS are parallel and therefore
¢R= E-AS = + 1.57 N m2 c—l.

(b) For any point on the side of the cylinder E is perpendicular to
AS and hence E-AS = 0. Therefore, the ﬂux out of the side of the
cylinder is zero.

(0) Net outward ﬂux through the cylinder
¢= 1.57 + 1.57 + o = 3.14 N m2 c—1

(d) The net charge within the cylinder can be found by using Gauss’s
law which gives
= 30¢
= 3.14 x 8.854 x 10—12 C
= 2.78 x 10—11 c
