When two or more waves traverse simultaneously in the same medium, the

displacement of any element of the medium is the algebraic sum of the displacements
due to each wave. This is known as the principle of superposition of waves

y=ifi(x — vt)

Two sinusoidal waves on the same string exhibit interference, adding or cancelling
according to the principle of superposition. If the two are travelling in the same
direction and have the same amplitude a and frequency but differ in phase by a phase
constant (1), the result is a single wave with the same frequency (0:

_ 1 . 1
le, t) - [Zacosiqb] sm(kx—wt +E¢j

If (1) = 0 or an integral multiple of 271', the waves are exactly in phase and the interference
is constructive; if q) = 7:, they are exactly out of phase and the interference is destructive.

A travelling wave, at a rigid boundary or a closed end, is reﬂected with a phase reversal
but the reﬂection at an open boundary takes place without any phase change.

For an incident wave
yi[x, t) = asin [kx— cot]
the reﬂected wave at a rigid boundary is
y,(X. t] = — asin [kx+ cot)

For reﬂection at an open boundary

yr(x,t) = asin (kx+ cat)
The interference of two identical waves moving in opposite directions produces standing
waves. For a string with fixed ends, the standing wave is given by

y[x, t) = [2a sin kx] cos cot

Standing waves are characterised by fixed locations of zero displacement called nodes
and fixed locations of maximum displacements called antinodes. The separation between
two consecutive nodes or antinodes is M 2.

A stretched string of length L fixed at both the ends vibrates with frequencies given by

n v

2 L ’
The set of frequencies given by the above relation are called the normal modes of
osciﬂation of the system. The oscillation mode with lowest frequency is called the

fundamental mode or the ﬁrst hamonic. The second hamonic is the oscillation mode
with n=2andso on.

v : n=1,2,3,...

A pipe of length L with one end closed and other end open (such as air columns)
vibrates with frequencies given by

v =(n+1/2) % n=0, 1,2,3,

The set of frequencies represented by the above relation are the nomial modes of
oscillation of such a system. The lowest frequency given by v/ 4L is the fundamental
mode or the first harmonic.

A string of length L fixed at both ends or an air column closed at one end and open at
the other end or open at both the ends, vibrates with certain frequencies called their
normal modes. Each of these frequencies is a resonant frequency of the system.

Beats arise when two waves having slightly different frequencies, v1 and v2 and
comparable amplitudes, are superposed. The beat frequency is
