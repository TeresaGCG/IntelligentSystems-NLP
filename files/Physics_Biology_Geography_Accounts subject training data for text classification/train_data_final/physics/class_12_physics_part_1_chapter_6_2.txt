moved towards the coil C1, the galvanometer shows a
deﬂection. This indicates that electric current is induced in
coil C1. When C2 is moved away, the galvanometer shows a
deﬂection again, but this time in the opposite direction. The
deﬂection lasts as long as coil C2 is in motion. When the coil
C2 is held ﬁxed and C1 is moved, the same effects are observed.
Again, it is the relative motion between the coils that induces
the electric current.

Experiment ()3

The above two experiments involved relative motion between
a magnet and a coil and between two coils, respectively.
Through another experiment, Faraday showed that this

It is observed that the galvanometer shows a momentary deﬂection
when the tapping key K is pressed. The pointer in the galvanometer returns
to zero immediately. If the key is held pressed continuously, there is no
deﬂection in the galvanometer. When the key is released, a momentory
deﬂection is observed again, but in the opposite direction. It is also observed
that the deﬂection increases dramatically when an iron rod is inserted
into the coils along their axis.

6.3 MAGNETIC FLUX

Faraday’s great insight lay in discovering a simple mathematical relation
to explain the series of experiments he carried out on electromagnetic
induction. However, before we state and appreciate his laws, we must get
familiar with the notion of magnetic ﬂux, (DB. Magnetic ﬂux is deﬁned in
the same way as electric ﬂux is deﬁned in Chapter 1. Magnetic ﬂux through
