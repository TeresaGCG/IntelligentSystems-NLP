In the first reaction, two protons combine to form a deuteron and
a positron with a release of 0.42 MeV energy. In reaction [13.29(b)], two
deuterons combine to form the light isotope of helium. In reaction
(13.290), two deuterons combine to form a triton and a proton. For
fusion to take place, the two nuclei must come close enough so that
attractive short-range nuclear force is able to affect them. However,
since they are both positively charged particles, they experience coulomb
repulsion. They, therefore, must have enough energy to overcome this
coulomb barrier. The height of the barrier depends on the charges and
radii of the two interacting nuclei. It can be shown, for example, that
the barrier height for two protons is ~ 400 keV, and is higher for nuclei
with higher charges. We can estimate the temperature at which two
protons in a proton gas would (averagely) have enough energy to
overcome the coulomb barrier:

(3/2)): T = K 2 400 keV, which gives T ~ 3 x 109 K.

When fusion is achieved by raising the temperature of the system so
that particles have enough kinetic energy to overcome the coulomb
repulsive behaviour, it is called thermonuclear fusion.

Thermonuclear fusion is the source of energy output in the interior
of stars. The interior of the sun has a temperature of l.5><107 K, which
is considerably less than the estimated temperature required for fusion
of particles of average energy. Clearly, fusion in the sun involves protons
whose energies are much above the average energy.

The fusion reaction in the sun is a multi-step process in which the
hydrogen is burned into helium. Thus, the fuel in the sun is the hydrogen
in its core. The proton-proton (p, p) cycle by which this occurs is
represented by the following sets of reactions:

}H+ }H—> 21H + e+ + v + 0.42 MeV (i)
e+ + e‘ —> y+ y+ 1.02 MeV (ii)
§H+ }H a 3He+ y+ 5.49 MeV (iii)
gHe +3He —>‘;He+}H+}H+ 12.86 MeV (iv) (13.30)

For the fourth reaction to occur, the first three reactions must occur
twice, in which case two light helium nuclei unite to form ordinary helium
nucleus. If we consider the combination 2(i) + 2(ii) + 2(iii) +(iv), the net
effect is

41H+2e‘ —> §He+2v+6y+26.7MeV
or (4}H+4e‘)—>(;He+2e—)+2v+6y+26.7Mev (13.31)

Thus, four hydrogen atoms combine to form an :He atom with a
release of 26.7 MeV of energy.

Helium is not the only element that can be synthesized in the interior
of a star. As the hydrogen in the core gets depleted and becomes helium,
the core starts to cool. The star begins to collapse under its own gravity
