In the inner region between the plates 1 and 2, the electric ﬁelds due
to the two charged plates add up, giving

The direction of electric field is from the positive to the negative plate.

Thus, the electric ﬁeld is localised between the two plates and is
uniform throughout. For plates with ﬁnite area, this will not be true near
the outer boundaries of the plates. The ﬁeld lines bend outward at the
edges — an effect called ‘fringing of the ﬁeld’. By the same token, owill
not be strictly uniform on the entire plate. [E and o are related by Eq.
(2.35).] However, for d2 << A, these effects can be ignored in the regions
sufficiently far from the edges, and the field there is given by Eq. (2.4 1).
Now for uniform electric field, potential difference is simply the electric
ﬁeld times the distance between the plates, that is,

The capacitance C of the parallel plate capacitor is then
_ Q _ _ 80A
— V — d (2.43)

which, as expected, depends only on the geometry of the system. For
typical values like A = 1 m2, d = 1 m, we get

(You can check that if 1F= IC V1 = 10 (NC—1m)‘1 = 1 C2 N‘lm‘l.)
This shows that 1F is too big a unit in practice, as remarked earlier.
Another way of seeing the ‘bigness’ of IF is to calculate the area of the

plates needed to have C = 1F for a separation of, say 1 cm:
g : 1F >< 10‘2m

80 8.85 x 10'12C2N'1m'2
which is a plate about 30 km in length and breadth!

2. 13 EFFECT OF DIELECTRIC ON CAPACITANCE

With the understanding of the behaviour of dielectrics in an external
ﬁeld developed in Section 2.1 0, let us see how the capacitance of a parallel
plate capacitor is modiﬁed when a dielectric is present. As before, we
have two large plates, each of area A, separated by a distance d. The
charge on the plates is iQ, corresponding to the charge density i6 (with
6 = Q/A). When there is vacuum between the plates,
