9.6.3 Shear Modulus
The ratio of shearing stress to the corresponding
shearing strain is called the shear modulus of
the material and is represented by G. It is also
called the modulus of rigidity.

G = shearing stress (as) / shearing strain

G = (F/AJ/(AX/L)

= (FxL)/(A><Ax) (9.10)
Similarly, from Eq. (9.4)
G = (F/A)/ 0
=F/(A>< 0) (9.11)
The shearing stress (SS can also be expressed as
(s = G x 0 (9.12)

S

SI unit of shear modulus is N m‘2 or Pa. The
shear moduli of a few common materials are
given in Table 9.2. It can be seen that shear
modulus (or modulus of rigidity) is generally less
than Young’s modulus (from Table 9. 1). For most
materials G 2 Y/ 3.

Example 9.4 A square lead slab of side 50
cm and thickness 10 cm is subject to a
shearing force (on its narrow face) of 9.0 x

104 N. The lower edge is riveted t0 the ﬂoor.
How much will the upper edge be displaced?

 

Answer The lead slab is fixed and the force is
applied parallel to the narrow face as shown in
Fig. 9.7. The area of the face parallel to which
this force is applied is

A =50cm>< 10cm
=0.5m><0.1m
=O.O5m2

2019-20

Therefore, the stress applied is
= (9.4 x 104 N/0.05 m2)
= 1.80 x 106 N.m‘2

 

Fig. 9.7

We know that shearing strain = (Ax/L)= Stress / G.

Therefore the displacement Ax = (Stress x L)/ G
= (1.8 x 106 N m‘2 x O.5m)/(5.6 x 109 N m‘z)
=1.6><104m=0.16mm 4

9.6.4 Bulk Modulus

In Section (9.3), we have seen that when a body
is submerged in a ﬂuid, it undergoes a hydraulic
stress (equal in magnitude to the hydraulic
pressure). This leads to the decrease in the
volume of the body thus producing a strain called
volume strain [Eq. (9.5)]. The ratio of hydraulic
stress to the corresponding hydraulic strain is
called bulk modulus. It is denoted by symbol B.

B=-P/(AV/V) (9.13)

The negative sign indicates the fact that with
an increase in pressure, a decrease in volume
occurs. That is, if p is positive, AV is negative.
Thus for a system in equilibrium, the value of
bulk modulus B is always positive. SI unit of
bulk modulus is the same as that of pressure
i.e., N m‘2 or Pa. The bulk moduli of a few
common materials are given in Table 9.3.

The reciprocal of the bulk modulus is called
compressibility and is denoted by k. It is defined
as the fractional change in volume per unit
increase in pressure.

k=(1/B)=-(1/AP)><(AV/V) (9.14)
It can be seen from the data given in Table
9.3 that the bulk moduli for solids are much

larger than for liquids, which are again much
larger than the bulk modulus for gases (air).
