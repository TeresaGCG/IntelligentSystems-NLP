Thus, mechanical energy which was needed to move the arm P9 is
converted into electrical energy (the induced emf) and then to thermal energy.
There is an interesting relationship between the charge ﬂow through
the circuit and the change in the magnetic ﬂux. From Faraday’s law, we
have learnt that the magnitude of the induced emf is,

Example 6.8 Refer to Fig. 6.12(a). The arm P9 of the rectangular
conductor is moved from x = O, outwards. The uniform magnetic ﬁeld is
perpendicular to the plane and extends from x = O to x = b and is zero
for x > b. Only the arm PQ possesses substantial resistance r. Consider
the situation when the arm P9 is pulled outwards from x = O to x = 2b,
and is then moved back to x = O with constant speed 0. Obtain expressions
for the ﬂux, the induced emf, the force necessaiy to pull the arm and the
power dissipated as Joule heat. Sketch the variation of these quantities
with distance.
