the value of the function remains the same. The
function f (t) is then periodic and its period, T,
is given by

27:
= — ( 1 4 . 3b)
60
Thus, the function f (t) is periodic with period T,
f (t) =f(t+T )

The same result is obviously correct if we
consider a sine function, f (t) = A sin wt. Further,
a linear combination of sine and cosine functions
like,

f(t) = Asin wt+Bcos cot (14.3c)
is also a periodic function with the same period
T. Taking,

A=Dcos q) and B=Dsin¢
Eq. (14.3c) can be written as,

f(t) = D sin (cot + (p) , (14.3d)
Here D and q) are constant given by

B
D=./A2 +32 and ¢= tan—1(2)

The great importance of periodic sine and
cosine functions is due to a remarkable result
proved by the French mathematician, Jean
Baptiste Joseph Fourier (1768—1830): Any
periodic function can be expressed as a
superposition of sine and cosine functions
of different time periods with suitable
coefficients.

Example 14.2 Which of the following
functions of time represent (a) periodic and
(b) non—periodic motion? Give the period for
each case of periodic motion (a) is any
positive constant].

(i) sin wt + cos wt

(ii) sin cot + cos 2 wt + sin 4 wt
(iii) e“”‘

(iv) log (wt)

 

Answer

(i) sin (0t + cos (at is a periodic function, it can

also be written as x/E sin (wt + 75/4).

Now 2 sin (cot + 7c/4)= 6 sin (cot + 7t/4+27t)

2019-20

= 2 sin [w(t + 27c/w) + 7c/4]

The periodic time of the function is 27c/ 60.

(ii) This is an example of a periodic motion. It
can be noted that each term represents a
periodic function with a different angular
frequency. Since period is the least interval
of time after which a function repeats its
value, sin cot has a period To: 27c/a); cos 2 cat
has a period Tc/a) =T0/ 2; and sin 4 cat has a
period 27c/4a) = TO/ 4. The period of the first
term is a multiple of the periods of the last
two terms. Therefore, the smallest interval
of time after which the sum of the three
terms repeats is To, and thus, the sum is a
periodic function with a period 27c/a).

(iii) The function e'm‘ is not periodic, it
decreases monotonically with increasing
time and tends to zero as t—> co and thus,
never repeats its value.

(iv) The function log(a)t) increases
monotonically with time t. It, therefore,
never repeats its value and is a non-
pen‘odic function. It may be noted that as
t—> 00, log(a)t) diverges to 00. It, therefore,
cannot represent any kind of physical
displacement. 4

14.3 SIMPLE HARMONIC MOTION

Consider a particle oscillating back and forth
about the origin of an x-axis between the limits
+A and —A as shown in Fig. 14.3. This oscillatory
motion is said to be simple harmonic if the

-A +A
<—>

Fig. 1 4.3 A particle vibrating back and forth about
the origin of x—axis, between the limits +A
and —A.

displacement x of the particle from the origin
varies with time as :

x (t) = A cos (a) t+ ¢) (14.4)
where A, a) and q) are constants.

Thus, simple harmonic motion (SHM) is not
any periodic motion but one in which
displacement is a sinusoidal function of time.
Fig. 14.4 shows the positions of a particle
executing SHM at discrete value of time, each
interval of time being T/ 4, where Tis the period
