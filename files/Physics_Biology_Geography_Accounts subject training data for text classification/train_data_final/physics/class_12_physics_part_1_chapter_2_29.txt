Solution
(a) In the given network, Cl, 02 and C3 are connected in series. The
effective capacitance C’ of these three capacitors is given by

l 1 1 l

C’ C1 02 03
For C1 = C2 = C3 = 10 “F, C’= (10/3) ”F. The network has 0’ and C4
connected in parallel. Thus, the equivalent capacitance C of the

network is

 

C = C’+ C4= (%+IO] uF =13.3uF

(b) Clearly, from the figure, the charge on each of the capacitors, Cl,
02 and C3 is the same, say Q. Let the charge on C4 be Q’. Now, since
the potential difference across AB is Q/Cl, across BC is Q/CZ, across

CD is Q/Cs, we have

Also, Q’/Q1 = 500 V.
This gives for the given value of the capacitances,

Q = 500V XEuF = 1.7 x10'3C and

ENERGY STORED IN A CAPACITOR

A capacitor, as we have seen above, is a system of two conductors with
charge Q and —Q. To determine the energy stored in this configuration,
consider initially two uncharged conductors 1 and 2. Imagine next a
process of transferring charge from conductor 2 to conductor 1 bit by

bit, so that at the end, conductor 1 gets charge Q. By
charge conservation, conductor 2 has charge —Q at
the end (Fig 2.30 ).

In transferring positive charge from conductor 2
to conductor 1, work will be done externally, since at
any stage conductor 1 is at a higher potential than
conductor 2. To calculate the total work done, we ﬁrst
calculate the work done in a small step involving
transfer of an inﬁnitesimal (i.e., vanishingly small)
amount of charge. Consider the intermediate situation
when the conductors l and 2 have charges Q’ and
—Q’respectively. At this stage, the potential difference
V’between conductors 1 to 2 is Q’/ C, where C is the
capacitance of the system. Next imagine that a small
charge 6 Q’ is transferred from conductor 2 to 1. Work
done in this step (6 W’), resulting in charge Q’ on
conductor 1 increasing to Q’+ 6 Q’, is given by
