Considering gravitational potential energy at
infinity to be zero, the potential energy at distance
(Re+h) from the centre of the earth is

GmME
(RE—+h) (8.41)

The K.E is positive whereas the PE is
negative. However, in magnitude the K.E. is half
the RE, so that the total E is

G m ME
2(RE +h) (842)

The total energy of an circularly orbiting
satellite is thus negative, with the potential
energy being negative but twice is magnitude of
the positive kinetic energy.

When the orbit of a satellite becomes
elliptic, both the K.E. and RE. vary from point
to point. The total energy which remains
constant is negative as in the circular orbit case.
This is what we expect, since as we have
discussed before if the total energy is positive or
zero, the object escapes to infinity. Satellites
are always at finite distance from the earth and
hence their energies cannot be positive or zero.

P.E=—

E =K.E+P.E=—

Example 8.8 A 400 kg satellite is in a circular
orbit of radius 2RE about the Earth. How much

energl is required to transfer it to a circular
orbit of radius 4RE? What are the changes in
the kinetic and potential energies ?

The kinetic energy is reduced and it mimics

The change in potential energy is twice the

8.11 GEOSTATIONARY AND POLAR
SATELLITES

An interesting phenomenon arises if in we
arrange the value of (RE+ h) such that T in
Eq. (8.37) becomes equal to 24 hours. If the
circular orbit is in the equatorial plane of the
earth, such a satellite, having the same period
as the period of rotation of the earth about its
own axis would appear stationery viewed from
a point on earth. The (RE + h) for this purpose
works out to be large as compared to RE :

(8.43)

T2GM “3
tar—E]

47!2

and for T= 24 hours, hworks out to be 35800 km.
which is much larger than RE. Satellites in a
circular orbits around the earth in the
equatorial plane with T = 24 hours are called
Geostationery Satellites. Clearly, since the earth
rotates with the same period, the satellite would
appear fixed from any point on earth. It takes
very powerful rockets to throw up a satellite to
such large heights above the earth but this has
been done in view of the several benefits of many
practical applications.

 

Fig. 8.1 1 A Polar satellite. A strip on earth’s surface
(shown shaded) is visible from the satellite
during one cycle. For the next revolution of
the satellite, the earth has rotated a little
on its axis so that an adjacent strip becomes
visible.

It is known that electromagnetic waves above
a certain frequency are not reﬂected from
ionosphere. Radio waves used for radio
broadcast which are in the frequency range 2
MHZ to 10 MHZ, are below the critical frequency.
They are therefore reﬂected by the ionosphere.
