Relative error = Aa / a (2.9)

mean mean

When the relative error is expressed in per
cent, it is called the percentage error (8a).

Thus, Percentage error

Let us now consider an example.

Example 2.6 Two clocks are being tested
against a standard clock located in a
national laboratory. At 12:00:00 noon by
the standard clock. the readings of the two
clocks are :

Clock 1 Clock 2

Monday 12:00:05 10: 15:06
Tuesday 12:01:15 10:14:59

Wednesday 11:59:08 10: 15: 18
Thursday 12:01 :50 10: 15:07
Friday 11:59: 15 10: 14:53
Saturday 12:01:30 10:15:24
Sunday 12:01:19 10:15:11

If you are doing an experiment that requires
precision time interval measurements. which
of the two clocks will you prefer ‘?

 

Answer The range of variation over the seven
days of observations is 162 s for clock 1, and
3 1 s for clock 2. The average reading of clock 1
is much closer to the standard time than the
average reading of clock 2. The important point
is that a clock’s zero error is not as significant
for precision work as its variation, because a
‘zero-error’ can always be easily corrected.
Hence clock 2 is to be preferred to clock 1. 4

Example 2.7 We measure the period of
oscillation of a simple pendulum. In
successive measurements. the readings

turn out to be 2.63 s. 2.56 s. 2.42 s. 2.71s
and 2.80 5. Calculate the absolute errors.

Answer The mean period of oscillation of the

pendulum

= 2.624 s
= 2.62 s

As the periods are measured to a resolution
of 0.01 s, all times are to the second decimal; it
is proper to put this mean period also to the
second decimal.

The errors in the measurements are

2.63s—2.62s= 0.01 s
2.56 s — 2.62 s = — 0.06 s
2.42 s — 2.62 s = — 0.20 s
2.71 s—2.62s= 0.09s
2.80s—2.62s= 0.18s

Note that the errors have the same units as the
quantity to be measured.

The arithmetic mean of all the absolute errors
(for arithmetic mean, we take only the
magnitudes) is

ATmem = [(0.01+ 0.06+0.20+0.09+0.18)s]/5
= 0.54 s/5
= 0.1 1 s

That means, the period of oscillation of the
simple pendulum is (2.62 i 0.11) s i.e. it lies
between (2.62 + 0.11) s and (2.62 — 0.11) s or
between 2.73 s and 2.51 s. As the arithmetic
mean of all the absolute errors is 0.1 1 s, there
is already an error in the tenth of a second.
Hence there is no point in giving the period to a
hundredth. A more correct way will be to write

T=2.6i0.1 S

Note that the last numeral 6 is unreliable, since
it may be anything between 5 and 7. We indicate
this by saying that the measurement has two
significant figures. In this case, the two
significant figures are 2, which is reliable and
6, which has an error associated with it. You
will learn more about the significant figures in
section 2.7.

For this example, the relative error or the
percentage error is

0.1
8a=—x100=4% 4

2.6.2 Combination of Errors

If we do an experiment involving several
measurements, we must know how the errors
in all the measurements combine. For example,
