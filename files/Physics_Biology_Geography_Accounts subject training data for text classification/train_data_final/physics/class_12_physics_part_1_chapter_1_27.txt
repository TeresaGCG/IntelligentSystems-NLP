From Eqs. (1. 15) and (1 . 18), it is clear that the dipole ﬁeld at large
distances does not involve q and a separately; it depends on the product
qa. This suggests the definition of dipole moment. The dipole moment
vector p of an electric dipole is defined by

p =q><2a13 (1.19)
that is, it is a vector whose magnitude is charge q times the separation
2a (between the pair of charges q, —q) and the direction is along the line
from —q to q. In terms of p, the electric field of a dipole at large distances
takes simple forms:
