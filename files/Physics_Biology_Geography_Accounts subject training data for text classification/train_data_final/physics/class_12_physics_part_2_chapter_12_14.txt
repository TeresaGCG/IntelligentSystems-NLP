This wavelength is so small that it is beyond any
measurement. This is the reason why macroscopic objects
in our daily life do not show wave-like properties. On the
other hand, in the sub-atomic domain, the wave character
of particles is signiﬁcant and measurable.

Consider an electron (mass m, charge e) accelerated
from rest through a potential V. The kinetic energy K
of the electron equals the work done (eV) on it by the
electric ﬁeld:

 

 

where V is the magnitude of accelerating potential in
volts. For a 120 V accelerating potential, Eq. (1 1. 1 1) gives
2. = 0.1 12 nm. This wavelength is of the same order as
the spacing between the atomic planes in crystals. This
suggests that matter waves associated with an electron could be veriﬁed
by crystal diffraction experiments analogous to X-ray diffraction. We
describe the experimental veriﬁcation of the de Broglie hypothesis in the
next section. In 1929, de Broglie was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics
for his discovery of the wave nature of electrons.

The matter—wave picture elegantly incorporated the Heisenberg’s
uncertainty principle. According to the principle, it is not possible to
measure both the position and momentum of an electron (or any other
particle) at the same time exactly. There is always some uncertainty (A x)
in the specification of position and some uncertainty (Ap) in the

speciﬁcation of momentum. The product of Axand Ap is of the order of h*
(with h = h/Zit), i.e.,

AxApzh (11.12)

Equation (1 1.12) allows the possibility that Axis zero; but then Ap
must be inﬁnite in order that the product is non-zero. Similarly, if Ap is
zero, Ax must be inﬁnite. Ordinarily, both Ax and Ap are non-zero such
that their product is of the order of h.

Now, if an electron has a deﬁnite momentum p, (i.e.Ap = O), by the de
Broglie relation, it has a deﬁnite wavelength A. A wave of deﬁnite (single)
