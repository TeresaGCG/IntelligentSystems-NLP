Karl Friedrich Gauss
(1777 - 1855) He was a
child prodigy and was gifted
in mathematics, physics,
engineering, astronomy
and even land surveying.
The properties of numbers
fascinated him, and in his
work he anticipated major
mathematical development
of later times. Along with
Wilhelm Welser, he built the
first electric telegraph in
1833. His mathematical
theory of curved surface
laid the foundation for the
later work of Riemann.

 

 

The situation is radically different for magnetic ﬁelds
which are continuous and form closed loops. Examine the
Gaussian surfaces represented by® or ® in Fig 5.3(a) or
Fig. 5.3(b). Both cases visually demonstrate that the
number of magnetic field lines leaving the surface is
balanced by the number of lines entering it. The net
magnetic ﬂux is zero for both the surfaces. This is true
for any closed surface.

 

FIGURE 5. 6

Consider a small vector area element AS of a closed
surface S as in Fig. 5.6. The magnetic ﬂux through AS is
deﬁned as A¢B = B-AS, where B is the ﬁeld at AS. We divide
S into many small area elements and calculate the
individual ﬂux through each. Then, the net ﬂux ¢B is,

$3 = [ME = ZB-AS = 0 (5.9)
'all' 'all'

where ‘all’ stands for ‘all area elements AS’. Compare this

with the Gauss’s law of electrostatics. The ﬂux through a closed surface
in that case is given by

ZEAS = l

80

where q is the electric charge enclosed by the surface.

The difference between the Gauss’s law of magnetism and that for
electrostatics is a reﬂection of the fact that isolated magnetic poles (also
called monopoles) are not known to exist. There are no sources or sinks
of B; the simplest magnetic element is a dipole or a current loop. All
magnetic phenomena can be explained in terms of an arrangement of
dipoles and / or current loops.

Thus, Gauss’s law for magnetism is:
The net magnetic ﬂux through any closed surface is zero.

EXAMPLE 5.6

Example 5.6 Many of the diagrams given in Fig. 5.7 show magnetic
field lines (thick lines in the figure) wrongly. Point out what is wrong
with them. Some of them may describe electrostatic field lines correctly.
Point out which ones.
