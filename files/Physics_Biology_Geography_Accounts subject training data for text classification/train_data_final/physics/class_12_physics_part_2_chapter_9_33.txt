where u and v are object and image distances, respectively and f is the
focal length of the mirror. f is (approximately) half the radius of
curvature R. f is negative for concave mirror; f is positive for a convex
mirror.

R1 and R2 are the radii of curvature of the lens surfaces, f is positive
for a converging lens; f is negative for a diverging lens. The power of a
lens P = 1 /f.

The SI unit for power of a lens is dioptre (D): 1 D = l m"1.

If several thin lenses of focal length fl, f2, f3,.. are in contact, the
effective focal length of their combination, is given by

Dispersion is the splitting of light into its constituent colour.
Magnifying power m of a simple microscope is given by m = 1 + (D/ f ),
where D = 25 cm is the least distance of distinct vision and f is the

focal length of the convex lens. If the image is at infinity, m = D/ f. For
a compound microscope, the magnifying power is given by
