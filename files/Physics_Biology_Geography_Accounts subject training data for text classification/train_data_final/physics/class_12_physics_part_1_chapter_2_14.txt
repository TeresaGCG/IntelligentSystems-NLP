Electrostatic Potential

and Capacitance

(We continue to take potential at inﬁnity to be zero.) Thus, work done in
bringing a charge q from inﬁnity to the point P in the external ﬁeld is qV.
This work is stored in the form of potential energy of q. If the point P has
position vector r relative to some origin, we can write:

Potential energy of q at r in an external ﬁeld

= qV(r) (2.27)

where V(r) is the external potential at the point r.

Thus, if an electron with charge q = e = 1.6X 10‘19 C is accelerated by
a potential difference of AV = 1 volt, it would gain energy of qAV = 1.6 X
lO‘ng. This unit of energy is defined as l electron volt or leV, i.e.,
1 eV=1.6 X 10‘19J. The units based on eV are most commonly used in
atomic, nuclear and particle physics, (1 keV= 103eV = 1.6 X 10‘16J , 1 MeV
= lOGeV = 1.6 x 10—13;], 1 GeV = lOQeV = 1.6 x 104% and 1 TeV= 1012eV
= 1.6 X 10‘7J). [This has already been deﬁned on Page 1 17, XI Physics
Part I, Table 6.1.]

2.8.2 Potential energy of a system of two charges in an
external field

Next, we ask: what is the potential energy of a system of two charges q1
and q2 located at rland r2, respectively, in an external ﬁeld? First, we
calculate the work done in bringing the charge q1 from infinity to r1.
Work done in this step is q1 V(r1), using Eq. (2.27). Next, we consider the
work done in bringing q2 to r2. In this step, work is done not only against
the external ﬁeld E but also against the field due to ‘11-

Work done on q2 against the external ﬁeld

= (12 Vtrzl

Work done on q2 against the ﬁeld due to q1

: c11q2
41t$0r12
where r12is the distance between q1 and q2. We have made use of Eqs.
(2.27) and (2.22). By the superposition principle for fields, we add up
the work done on q2 against the two ﬁelds (E and that due to ql):
Work done in bringing q2 to r2

c11q2

: q2V(r2) + (2.28)

Thus,
Potential energy of the system
= the total work done in assembling the conﬁguration

47:.90r12

 

: q1V(r1)+ q2V(r2)+ (2.29)

Example 2.5

(a) Determine the electrostatic potential energy of a system consisting
of two charges 7 “C and —2 uC (and with no external field) placed
at {—9 cm, 0, O) and (9 cm, 0, 0) respectively.

(b) How much work is required to separate the two charges infinitely
away from each other?
