For an area element of a closed surface, fl is taken to be the direction
of outward normal, by convention.

Gauss ’s law: The ﬂux of electric ﬁeld through any closed surface S is
1 /80 times the total charge enclosed by S. The law is especially useful
in determining electric ﬁeld E, when the source dist1ibution has simple
symmetry:

(i) Thin inﬁnitely long straight wire of uniform linear charge density )1

A A

E: n
27c£0r

 

where r is the perpendicular distance of the point from the wire and

ﬁis the radial unit vector in the plane normal to the wire; passing
through the point. \

( ii) Inﬁnite thin plane sheet of uniform surface charge density 0'

 

where 11 is a unit vector nonnal to the plane, outward on either side.
(iii) Thin sphericaLLShejllxof unifomi surface charge density 0
E=L2rii ‘ (r 2 R)

4 7:80 r ‘ _
E=0 (r < R)”
where ;r is: the distance of the point from the centre of the shell and R
the radius of the shell. q is the total charge of the shell: q = 47tR26.

The electric ﬁeld outside the shell is as though the total charge is
concentrated at the centre. The same result is true for a solid sphere
of uniform volume ‘charge density. The ﬁeld is zero at all points inside

the shell.
