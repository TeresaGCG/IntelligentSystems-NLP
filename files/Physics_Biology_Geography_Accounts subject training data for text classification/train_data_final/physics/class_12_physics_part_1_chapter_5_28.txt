A closely wound solenoid of 800 turns and area of cross section
2.5 X 10’4 m2 carries a current of 3.0 A. Explain the sense in which
the solenoid acts like a bar magnet. What is its associated magnetic
moment?

If the solenoid in Exercise 5.5 is free to turn about the vertical
direction and a uniform horizontal magnetic field of 0.25 T is applied,
what is the magnitude of torque on the solenoid when its axis makes
an angle of 30° with the direction of applied field?

A bar magnet of magnetic moment 1.5 J T ’1 lies aligned with the
direction of a uniform magnetic ﬁeld of 0.22 T.

(a) What is the amount of work required by an external torque to
turn the magnet so as to align its magnetic moment: (i) normal
to the field direction, (ii) opposite to the field direction?

(b) What is the torque on the magnet in cases (i) and (ii)?

A closely wound solenoid of 2000 turns and area of cross-section

1.6 X 10’4 m2, carrying a current of 4.0 A, is suspended through its

centre allowing it to turn in a horizontal plane.

(a) What is the magnetic moment associated with the solenoid?

(b) What is the force and torque on the solenoid if a uniform
horizontal magnetic field of 7.5 X 10’2 T is set up at an angle of
30° with the axis of the solenoid?

A circular coil of 16 turns and radius 10 cm carrying a current of

0.75 A rests with its plane normal to an external ﬁeld of magnitude

5.0 X 10’2 T. The coil is free to turn about an axis in its plane

perpendicular to the field direction. When the coil is turned slightly

and released, it oscillates about its stable equilibrium with a

frequency of 2.0 s’l. What is the moment of inertia of the coil about

its axis of rotation?

A magnetic needle free to rotate in a vertical plane parallel to the
magnetic meridian has its north tip pointing down at 22° with the
horizontal. The horizontal component of the earth’s magnetic field
at the place is known to be 0.35 G. Determine the magnitude of the
earth’s magnetic field at the place.

At a certain location in Africa, a compass points 12° west of the
geographic north. The north tip of the magnetic needle of a dip circle
placed in the plane of magnetic meridian points 60° above the
horizontal. The horizontal component of the earth’s ﬁeld is measured
to be 0.16 G. Specify the direction and magnitude of the earth’s field
at the location.

A short bar magnet has a magnetic moment of 0.48 J T’l. Give the
direction and magnitude of the magnetic field produced by the magnet
at a distance of 10 cm from the centre of the magnet on (a) the axis,
(b) the equatorial lines (normal bisector) of the magnet.

A short bar magnet placed in a horizontal plane has its axis aligned
along the magnetic north-south direction. Null points are found on
the axis of the magnet at 14 cm from the centre of the magnet. The
earth’s magnetic field at the place is 0.36 G and the angle of dip is
zero. What is the total magnetic ﬁeld on the normal bisector of the
magnet at the same distance as the null—point (i.e., 14 cm) from the
centre of the magnet? (At null points, ﬁeld due to a magnet is equal
and opposite to the horizontal component of earth’s magnetic field.)

If the bar magnet in exercise 5.13 is turned around by 180°, where
will the new null points be located?
