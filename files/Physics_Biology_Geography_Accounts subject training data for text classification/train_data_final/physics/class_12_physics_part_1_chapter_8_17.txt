A parallel plate capacitor (Fig. 8.7) made of circular plates each of radius
R = 6.0 cm has a capacitance C = 100 pF. The capacitor is connected to
a 230 V ac supply with a (angular) frequency of 300 rad $4.

(a) What is the rms value of the conduction current?

(b) Is the conduction current equal to the displacement current?

(0) Determine the amplitude of B at a point 3.0 cm from the axis
between the plates.

500m?

A plane electromagnetic wave travels in vacuum along z—direction.
What can you say about the directions of its electric and magnetic
field vectors? If the frequency of the wave is 30 MHZ, what is its
wavelength?

A radio can tune in to any station in the 7.5 MHZ to 12 MHZ band.
What is the corresponding wavelength band?

A charged particle oscillates about its mean equilibrium position
with a frequency of 109 Hz. What is the frequency of the
electromagnetic waves produced by the oscillator?

The amplitude of the magnetic field part of a harmonic
electromagnetic wave in vacuum is B0 = 510 nT. What is the
amplitude of the electric field part of the wave?

Suppose that the electric field amplitude of an electromagnetic wave
is E0 = 120 N/ C and that its frequency is v = 50.0 MHZ. (a) Determine,
30.0). k, and x1. (b) Find expressions for E and B.

The terminology of different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum
is given in the text. Use the formula E = hv (for energy of a quantum
of radiation: photon) and obtain the photon energy in units of eV for
different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. In what way are
the different scales of photon energies that you obtain related to the
sources of electromagnetic radiation?

In a plane electromagnetic wave, the electric field oscillates
sinusoidally at a frequency of 2.0 X 1010 Hz and amplitude 48 V m’l.
