EXAMPLE 11.2

 

(i) In interaction of radiation with matter, radiation behaves as if it is
made up of particles called photons.

(ii) Each photon has energy E (= hv) and momentum p (= h v/c), and
speed c, the speed of light.

(iii) All photons of light of a particular frequency v, or wavelength A, have
the same energy E (=hv = hc/ﬂ.) and momentum p (= hv/c= h/l),
whatever the intensity of radiation may be. By increasing the intensity
of light of given wavelength, there is only an increase in the number of
photons per second crossing a given area, with each photon having
the same energy. Thus, photon energy is independent of intensity of
radiation.

(iv) Photons are electrically neutral and are not deﬂected by electric and
magnetic ﬁelds.

(v) In a photon-particle collision (such as photon-electron collision), the
total energy and total momentum are conserved. However, the number
of photons may not be conserved in a collision. The photon may be
absorbed or a new photon may be created.

Example 11.1 Monochromatic light of frequency 6.0 ><1014 Hz is
produced by a laser. The power emitted is 2.0 ><10‘3 W. (a) What is the
energy of a photon in the light beam? (b) How many photons per second,
on an average, are emitted by the source?

Solution
(a) Each photon has an energy
E = h v = (6.63 ><10‘34 J s) (6.0 x1014 Hz)
= 3.98 x 10—ng
(b) If N is the number of photons emitted by the source per second,
the power P transmitted in the beam equals N times the energy
per photon E, so that P = N E. Then

_ P _ 2.0x10'3W

N _ _—
E 3.98x10‘19J
= 5.0 ><1015 photons per second.

Example 11.2 The work function of caesium is 2.14 eV. Find (a) the
threshold frequency for caesium, and (b) the wavelength of the incident
light if the photocurrent is brought to zero by a stopping potential of
0.60 V.

Solution

(a) For the cut-off or threshold frequency, the energy h vO of the incident
radiation must be equal to work function ¢0, so that

v0: &_ 2.14eV

h 6.63x10'34Js

_ 2.14 xl.6>< 10ng

6.63 x 10‘34J 5
Thus, for frequencies less than this threshold frequency, no
photoelectrons are ejected.
(b) Photocurrent reduces to zero, when maximum kinetic energy of
the emitted photoelectrons equals the potential energy e VO by the
retarding potential V0. Einstein’s Photoelectric equation is

= 5.16 x1014 Hz
