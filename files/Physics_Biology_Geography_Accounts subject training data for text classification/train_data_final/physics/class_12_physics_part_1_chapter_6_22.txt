EXAMPLE 6.11

In commercial generators, the mechanical energy required for rotation
of the armature is provided by water falling from a height, for example,
from dams. These are called hydro-electric generators. Alternatively, water
is heated to produce steam using coal or other sources. The steam at
high pressure produces the rotation of the armature. These are called
thermal generators. Instead of coal, if a nuclear fuel is used, we get nuclear
power generators. Modern day generators produce electric power as high
as 500 MW, i.e., one can light up 5 million 100 W bulbs! In most
generators, the coils are held stationary and it is the electromagnets which
are rotated. The frequency of rotation is 50 Hz in India. In certain countries
such as USA, it is 60 Hz.

Example 6.11 Kamla peddles a stationary bicycle. The pedals of the
bicycle are attached to a 100 turn coil of area 0.10 m2. The coil rotates
at half a revolution per second and it is placed in a uniform magnetic
field of 0.01 T perpendicular to the axis of rotation of the coil. What is
the maximum voltage generated in the coil?

Solution Here v = 0.5 Hz; N =lOO, A = 0.1 m2 and B = 0.01 T. Employing
Eq. (6.2 1)

80 = NBA (27cv)
= 100 X 0.01 X 0.1 X 2 X 3.14 X 0.5

= 0.314 V
The maximum voltage is 0.314 V.

We urge you to explore such alternative possibilities for power
generation.
