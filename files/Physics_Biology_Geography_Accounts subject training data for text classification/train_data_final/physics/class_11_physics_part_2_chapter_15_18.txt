stationary but the source is moving, (2) observer
is moving but the source is stationary, and (3)
both the observer and the source are moving.
The situations (1) and (2) differ from each other
because of the absence or presence of relative
motion between the observer and the medium.
Most waves require a medium for their
propagation; however, electromagnetic waves do
not require any medium for propagation. If there
is no medium present, the Doppler shifts are
same irrespective of whether the source moves
or the observer moves, since there is no way of
distinction between the two situations.

15.8. 1 Source Moving ; Observer Stationary

Let us choose the convention to take the
direction from the observer to the source as
the positive direction of velocity. Consider a
source S moving with velocity US and an observer
who is stationary in a frame in which the
medium is also at rest. Let the speed of a wave
of angular frequency a) and period To, both
measured by an observer at rest with respect to
the medium, be D. We assume that the observer
has a detector that counts every time a wave
crest reaches it. As shown in
Fig. 15.17, at time t = O the source is at point SI,
located at a distance L from the observer, and
emits a crest. This reaches the observer at time
t1 = L/ 1). At time t= TO the source has moved a
distance vSTo and is at point S2, located at a
distance (L + vsTo) from the observer. At S2, the
source emits a second crest. This reaches the
observer at

Equation (15.49) may be rewritten in terms
of the frequency v0 that would be measured if
the source and observer were stationary, and
the frequency v observed when the source is
moving, as

v = Vo 1+: (15.50)

If Us is small compared with the wave speed v,
taking binomial expansion to terms in ﬁrst order
in v5/ v and neglecting higher power, Eq. (15.50)
may be approximated, giving

v = v0[1—vf] (15.51)

For a source approaching the observer, we
replace us by — Us to get

v = v0[1+vfj (15.52)

The observer thus measures a lower frequency
when the source recedes from him than he does
when it is at rest. He measures a higher
frequency when the source approaches him.

Stationary

Now to derive the Doppler shift when the
observer is moving with velocity v0 towards the
source and the source is at rest, we have to
proceed in a different manner. We work in the
