experience magnetic force due to the motion of the rod. Explain.

(d) What is the retarding force on the rod when K is closed?

(e) How much power is required (by an external agent) to keep
the rod moving at the same speed (=12 cm s*1) when K is closed?
How much power is required when K is open?

(f) How much power is dissipated as heat in the closed circuit?
What is the source of this power?

(g) What is the induced emf in the moving rod if the magnetic field
is parallel to the rails instead of being perpendicular?

An air-cored solenoid with length 30 cm, area of cross-section 25 cm2

and number of turns 500, carries a current of 2.5 A. The current is

suddenly switched off in a brief time of 103 s. How much is the average
back emf induced across the ends of the open switch in the circuit?

Ignore the variation in magnetic field near the ends of the solenoid.

(a) Obtain an expression for the mutual inductance between a long
straight wire and a square loop of side a as shown in Fig. 6.21.

(b) Now assume that the straight wire carries a current of 50 A and
the loop is moved to the right with a constant velocity, v = 10 m/s.
Calculate the induced emf in the loop at the instant when x = 0.2 m.
Take a = 0.1 m and assume that the loop has a large resistance.

 

FIGURE 6.21

A line charge A per unit length is lodged uniformly onto the rim of a
wheel of mass M and radius R. The wheel has light non-conducting
spokes and is free to rotate without friction about its axis (Fig. 6.22).
A uniform magnetic field extends over a circular region within the
rim. It is given by,

B=â€”B0k (rSa;a<R)

= 0 (otherwise)

What is the angular velocity of the wheel after the field is suddenly
switched off?
