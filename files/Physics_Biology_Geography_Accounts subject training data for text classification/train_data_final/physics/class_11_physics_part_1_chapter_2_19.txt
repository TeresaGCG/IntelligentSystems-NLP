Fill in the blanks

[a] The volume of a cube of side 1 cm is equal to ..... m3

[b] The surface area of a solid cylinder of radius 2.0 cm and height 10.0 cm is equal to
...[mm]2

[c] A vehicle moving with a speed of 18 km h’1 covers....m in 1 s

(d) The relative density of lead is 1 1.3. Its density is ....g cm’3 or ....kg mi3.

Fill in the blanks by suitable conversion of units
(a) 1 kg m2 5’2 = ....g cmzsr2

(b) 1 m = ..... 1y

[0) 3.0 m s*2 = km h’2

[d] G = 6.67 x 10’11 N m2 [kg]’2 = [cm]3 s*2 g1.

A calorie is a unit of heat [energy in transit) and it equals about 4.2 J where 1J =
1 kg m2 s”. Suppose we employ a system of units in which the unit of mass equals 05
kg, the unit of length equals [3 m, the unit of time is ys. Show that a calorie has a
magnitude 4.2 (1’1 [3’2 Y2 in terms of the new units.

Explain this statement clearly :

“To call a dimensional quantity ‘large’ or ‘small’ is meaningless without specifying a
standard for comparison”. In view of this, reframe the following statements wherever
necessary :

(a) atoms are very small objects

[b] a jet plane moves with great speed

[c] the mass of Jupiter is very large

(d) the air inside this room contains a large number of molecules

[e] a proton is much more massive than an electron

[f] the speed of sound is much smaller than the speed of light.

A new unit of length is chosen such that the speed of light in vacuum is unity. What
is the distance between the Sun and the Earth in terms of the new unit if light takes
8 min and 20 s to cover this distance ?

Which of the following is the most precise device for measuring length :

(a) a vernier callipers with 20 divisions on the sliding scale

(b) a screw gauge of pitch 1 mm and 100 divisions on the circular scale

(c) an optical instrument that can measure length to within a wavelength of light ?

A student measures the thickness of a human hair by looking at it through a
microscope of magnification 100. He makes 20 observations and finds that the average
width of the hair in the field of view of the microscope is 3.5 mm. What is the
estimate on the thickness of hair ?

Answer the following :

[a)You are given a thread and a metre scale. How will you estimate the diameter of
the thread ?

[b)A screw gauge has a pitch of 1.0 mm and 200 divisions on the circular scale. Do
you think it is possible to increase the accuracy of the screw gauge arbitrarily by
increasing the number of divisions on the circular scale ?

[c] The mean diameter of a thin brass rod is to be measured by vernier callipers. Why
is a set of 100 measurements of the diameter expected to yield a more reliable
estimate than a set of 5 measurements only ?

The photograph of a house occupies an area of 1.75 cm2 on a 35 mm slide. The slide
is projected on to a screen, and the area of the house on the screen is 1.55 m2. What
is the linear magnification of the projector—screen arrangement.

2.10 State the number of significant figures in the following :

(a) 0.007 m2
(b) 2.64 X 1024 kg
[C] 0.2370 g cm’3
