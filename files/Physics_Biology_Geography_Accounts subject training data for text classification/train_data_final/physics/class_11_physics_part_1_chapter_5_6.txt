t (5.2)

For a body of fixed mass m,

d_P : 1(mv) : md_" : ma (5.3)
dt dt dt

i.e the Second Law can also be written as
F = k ma (5.4)

which shows that force is proportional to the
product of mass m and acceleration a.

The unit of force has not been defined so far.
In fact, we use Eq. (5.4) to deﬁne the unit of force.
We, therefore, have the liberty to choose any
constant value for k. For simplicity, we choose
k = 1. The second law then is

dp_

F: E — ma (5.5)

In SI unit force is one that causes an acceleration
of 1 m s2 to a mass of 1 kg. This unit is known as
newton: 1 N = 1 kgm s2.

Let us note at this stage some important points
about the second law :

1. In the second law, F = 0 implies a = O. The
second law is obviously consistent with the
first law.

2. The second law of motion is a vector law. It is
equivalent to three equations, one for each
component of the vectors :

 

 

dp
FX 2 dtx = max
dpy
Fy = — 2 may
dt
dp
Fz= dtz=m a2 (5.6)

This means that if a force is not parallel to
the velocity of the body, but makes some angle
with it, it changes only the component of
velocity along the direction of force. The
component of velocity normal to the force
remains unchanged. For example, in the
motion of a projectile under the vertical
gravitational force, the horizontal component
of velocity remains unchanged (Fig. 5.5).

3. The second law of motion given by Eq. (5.5) is
applicable to a single point particle. The force
F in the law stands for the net external force

on the particle and a stands for acceleration
of the particle. It turns out, however, that the
law in the same form applies to a rigid body or,
even more generally, to a system of particles.
In that case, F refers to the total external force
on the system and a refers to the acceleration
of the system as a whole. More precisely, a is
the acceleration of the centre of mass of the
system about which we shall study in detail in
chapter 7. Any internal forces in the system
are not to be included in F.

 

Fig. 5.5 Acceleration at an instant is detem1ined by
the force at that instant. The moment after a
stone is dropped out of an accelerated train,

it has no horizontal acceleration or force, if

air resistance is neglected. The stone carries
no memory of its acceleration with the train
a moment ago.

4. The second law of motion is a local relation
which means that force F at a point in space
(location of the particle) at a certain instant
of time is related to a at that point at that
instant. Acceleration here and now is
determined by the force here and now, not by
any history of the motion of the particle
(See Fig. 5.5).

> Example 5.2 A bullet of mass 0.04 kg
moving with a speed of 90 m s'1 enters a
heavy wooden block and is stopped after a

distance of 60 cm. What is the average
resistive force exerted by the block on the
bullet?

 

Answer The retardation ‘a’ of the bullet
(assumed constant) is given by
—u2 _ —90 x 90
