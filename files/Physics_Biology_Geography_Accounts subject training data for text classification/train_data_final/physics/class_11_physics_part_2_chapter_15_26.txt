WAV ES 3 9 3

beat frequency is found to reduce to 3 Hz. If the original frequency of A is 324 Hz,
what is the frequency of B?

15.19 Explain why [or how):

(a) in a sound wave, a displacement node is a pressure antinode and vice versa,

[b] bats can ascertain distances, directions, nature, and sizes of the obstacles
without any “eyes”,

(c) a violin note and sitar note may have the same frequency, yet we can
distinguish between the two notes,

(d) solids can support both longitudinal and transverse waves, but only
longitudinal waves can propagate in gases, and

(e) the shape of a pulse gets distorted during propagation in a dispersive medium.

15.20 A train, standing at the outer signal of a railway station blows a whistle of frequency
400 Hz in still air. [i] What is the frequency of the whistle for a platform observer
when the train [a] approaches the platform with a speed of 10 m s‘l, [b] recedes
from the platform with a speed of 10 m s51? [ii] What is the speed of sound in each
case ? The speed of sound in still air can be taken as 340 m s’l.

15.21 A train, standing in a station—yard, blows a whistle of frequency 400 Hz in still
air. The wind starts blowing in the direction from the yard to the station with a
speed of 10 m s51. What are the frequency, wavelength, and speed of sound for an
observer standing on the station’s platform? Is the situation exactly identical to
the case when the air is still and the observer runs towards the yard at a speed of
10 m s’l? The speed of sound in still air can be taken as 340 m s’1

15.22 A travelling harmonic wave on a string is described by
y(x, t) = 7.5 sin [0.0050x+12t + 7r/4]

(a)what are the displacement and velocity of oscillation of a point at
x = 1 cm, and t = 1 s? Is this velocity equal to the velocity of wave propagation?

[b]Locate the points of the string which have the same transverse displacements
and velocity as the x = 1 cm point at t= 2 s, 5 s and 1 1 s.

15.23 A narrow sound pulse (for example, a short pip by a whistle) is sent across a
medium. (a) Does the pulse have a definite (i) frequency, (ii) wavelength, (iii) speed
of propagation? (b) If the pulse rate is 1 after every 20 s, (that is the whistle is
blown for a split of second after every 20 s), is the frequency of the note produced
by the whistle equal to 1 / 20 or 0.05 Hz ?

15.24 One end of a long string of linear mass density 8.0 X 10’3 kg mi1 is connected to an
electrically driven tuning fork of frequency 256 Hz. The other end passes over a
pulley and is tied to a pan containing a mass of 90 kg. The pulley end absorbs all
the incoming energy so that reﬂected waves at this end have negligible amplitude.
At t= 0, the left end [fork end] of the string x = 0 has zero transverse displacement
[y = 0) and is moving along positive y—direction. The amplitude of the wave is 5.0
cm. Write down the transverse displacement y as function of xand tthat describes
the wave on the string.

15.25 A SONAR system fixed in a submarine operates at a frequency 40.0 kHz. An enemy
submarine moves towards the SONAR with a speed of 360 km h’l. What is the
frequency of sound reﬂected by the submarine ? Take the speed of sound in water
to be 1450 m s51.
