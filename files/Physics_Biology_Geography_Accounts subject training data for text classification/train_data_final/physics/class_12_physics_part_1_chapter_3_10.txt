Resistors in the higher range are made mostly from carbon. Carbon
resistors are compact, inexpensive and thus ﬁnd extensive use in electronic
circuits. Carbon resistors are small in size and hence their values are
given using a colour code.

The resistors have a set of co-axial coloured rings
on them whose signiﬁcance are listed in Table 3.2. The
ﬁrst two bands from the end indicate the first two

     

signiﬁcant figures of the resistance in ohms. The third I, #
band indicates the decimal multiplier (as listed in Table / / \ \
3.2). The last band stands for tolerance or possible Red Red Red Silver

variation in percentage about the indicated values.
Sometimes, this last band is absent and that indicates
a tolerance of 20% (Fig. 3.8). For example, if the four
colours are orange, blue, yellow and gold, the resistance
value is 36 X 104 £2, with a tolerence value of 5%.

3.8 TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE OF
RESISTIVITY

The resistivity of a material is found to be dependent on
the temperature. Different materials do not exhibit the
same dependence on temperatures. Over a limited range
of temperatures, that is not too large, the resistivity of a
metallic conductor is approximately given by,

p, = p0 [1 + a (T—TOJI (3.26)

Where pT is the resistivity at a temperature T and p0 is the same at a
reference temperature To. a is called the temperature co-eﬁicient of
resistivity, and from Eq. (3.26), the dimension of 0c is (Temperature)‘1. 103
