examples and identify the fulcrum, the effort and
effort arm, and the load and the load arm of the
lever in each case.

You may easily show that the principle of
moment holds even when the parallel forces F1
and F2 are not perpendicular, but act at some

angle, to the lever.

7.8.2 Centre of gravity

Many of you may have the experience of
balancing your notebook on the tip of a finger.
Figure 7 .24 illustrates a similar experiment that
you can easily perform. Take an irregular-
shaped cardboard having mass M and a narrow
tipped object like a pencil. You can locate by trial
and error a point G on the cardboard where it
can be balanced on the tip of the pencil. (The
cardboard remains horizontal in this position.)
This point of balance is the centre of gravity (CG)
of the cardboard. The tip of the pencil provides
a vertically upward force due to which the
cardboard is in mechanical equilibrium. As
shown in the Fig. 7 .24, the reaction of the tip is
equal and opposite to Mg and hence the
cardboard is in translational equilibrium. It is
also in rotational equilibrium; if it were not so,
due to the unbalanced torque it would tilt and
fall. There are torques on the card board due to
the forces of gravity like mlg, ng etc, acting
on the individual particles that make up the
cardboard.

 

Fig. 7.24 Balancing a cardboard on the tip of a
pencil. The point of support, G, is the
centre of gravity.

The CG of the cardboard is so located that

the total torque on it due to the forces mg, mg
. etc. is zero.

If ri is the position vector of the ith particle
of an extended body with respect to its CG, then
the torque about the CG, due to the force of
gravity on the particle is It: riX mg. The total
gravitational torque about the CG is zero, i.e.

tg=Zti=Zrixmig=0 (7.33)

We may therefore, define the CG of a body
as that point where the total gravitational torque
on the body is zero.

We notice that in Eq. (7 .33), g is the same
for all particles, and hence it comes out of the
summation. This gives, since g is non-zero,

Z mirl. = 0. Remember that the position vectors

(1",) are taken with respect to the CG. Now, in
accordance with the reasoning given below
Eq. (7.4a) in Sec. 7 .2, if the sum is zero, the origin
must be the centre of mass of the body. Thus,
the centre of gravity of the body coincides with
the centre of mass in uniform gravity or gravity-
free space. We note that this is true because
the body being small, g does not

lies on the vertical AA 1 through the point
of suspension of the body A.
