[Eq. (3.57) between the positive terminal P and the negative terminal N; I
here is the current ﬂowing from N to P through the cell]. If, while labelling
the current I through the cell one goes from P to N,
then of course

Having clariﬁed labelling, we now state the rules
and the proof:

(a) Junction rule: At any junction, the sum of the
currents entering the junction is equal to the
sum of currents leaving the junction (Fig. 3.22).

This applies equally well if instead of a junction of

several lines, we consider a point in a line.

The proof of this rule follows from the fact that
when currents are steady, there is no accumulation
of charges at any junction or at any point in a line.
Thus, the total current ﬂowing in, (which is the rate
at which charge ﬂows into the j unction), must equal
the total current ﬂowing out.

that will also be II. For the loops ‘ahdcba' (b) LOOP rule: The algebraic sum Of Changes in
and ‘ahdefga', the loop rules give _3011 _ potential around any closed loop involving

41 I3 + 45 = 0 and ~30], + 21 I2 - 80 = 0. resistors and cells in the loop is zero (Fig. 3.22).

This rule is also obvious, since electric potential is
dependent on the location of the point. Thus starting with any point if we
come back to the same point, the total change must be zero. In a closed
loop, we do come back to the starting point and hence the rule.

Example 3.6 A battery of 10 V and negligible internal resistance is
connected across the diagonally opposite corners of a cubical network
consisting of 12 resistors each of resistance 1 £2 (Fig. 3.23). Determine
the equivalent resistance of the network and the current along each
edge of the cube.
