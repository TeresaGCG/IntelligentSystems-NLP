In the double-slit experiment shown in Fig. 10.12(b), we have taken
the source hole S on the perpendicular bisector of the two slits, which is
shown as the line SO. What happens if the source S is slightly away
from the perpendicular bisector. Consider that the source is moved to 5.
some new point S’ and suppose that Q is the mid-point of S1 and S2. If " ~ .

point O’at an angle —¢, which means that it is shifted by the same angle
on the other side of the bisector. This also means that the source S’, the
mid-point Q and the point 0’ of the central fringe are in a straight line.

We end this section by quoting from the Nobel lecture of Dennis Gabor*

The wave nature of light was demonstrated convincingly for the
ﬁrst time in 1801 by Thomas Young by a wonderfully simple
experiment. He let a ray of sunlight into a dark room, placed a
dark screen in front of it, pierced with two small pinholes, and
beyond this, at some distance, a white screen. He then saw two
darkish lines at both sides of a bright line, which gave him
sufficient encouragement to repeat the experiment, this time with
spirit flame as light source, with a little salt in it to produce the
bright yellow sodium light. This time he saw a number of dark
lines, regularly spaced; the first clear proof that light added to
light can produce darkness. This phenomenon is called
