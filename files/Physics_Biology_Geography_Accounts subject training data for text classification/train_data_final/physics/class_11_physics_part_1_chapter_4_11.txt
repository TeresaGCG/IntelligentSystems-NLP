Or, r=r0+vot+§at (4.34a) d
r

It can be easily verified that the derivative of

d
Eq. (4.34a), i.e. d—lf gives Eq.(4.33a) and it also

satisfies the condition that at t=0, r = r0.
Equation (4.34a) can be written in component
form as

l
x = x0 + voxt + Eaxt2

l
y 2 yo + voyt + ant2

(4.34b)
One immediate interpretation of Eq.(4.34b) is that
the motions in x- and ydirections can be treated
independently of each other. That is, motion in
a plane (two-dimensions) can be treated as two
separate simultaneous one-dimensional
motions with constant acceleration along two
perpendicular directions. This is an important
result and is useful in analysing motion of objects
in two dimensions. A similar result holds for three
dimensions. The choice of perpendicular
directions is convenient in many physical
situations, as we shall see in section 4.10 for
projectile motion.

’ Example 4.5 A particle starts from origin
at t = O with a velocity 5.0 i m/s and moves
in x—y plane under action of a force which
produces a constant acceleration of

(3.0i+2.0j) m/sz. (a) What is the
y-coordinate of the particle at the instant

its x—coordinate is 84 m ‘? (b) What is the
speed of the particle at this time ?

 

Answer From Eq. (4.34a) for ro= O, the position
of the particle is given by

1
r (t) = vot+§at2

= 5.0it+(1/2)(3.0i+2.oj) t2
= (5.0t+ 1.5t2)i+ 1.0th

Therefore, x (t) = 5.0t + 1.5t2

y(t)=+1.0t2

Now, the velocity v = E = (5.0 + 3.0 t)i + 2.0t 3

At t= 6 s. v = 23.0i+12.oj
speed = |v| = V232 + 122 5 26 m sT1_ {

4.9 REIATIVE VELOCITY IN TWO
DIMENSIONS

The concept of relative velocity, introduced in
section 3.7 for motion along a straight line, can
be easily extended to include motion in a plane
or in three dimensions. Suppose that two objects
A and B are moving with velocities vA and vB
(each with respect to some common frame of
reference, say ground.). Then, velocity of object
A relative to that of B is :

VAB= vA—vB (4.35a)

and similarly, the velocity of object B relative to
that ofA is :

vBA = VB_ VA
Therefore, vAB = — vBA (4.35b)
and, MB] = vaA‘ (4.35c)

 

b Example 4.6 Rain is falling vertically with
a speed of 35 m 5‘1. A woman rides a bicycle
with a speed of 12 m 5'1 in east to west
direction. What is the direction in which
she should hold her umbrella ‘?

 

 

Answer In Fig. 4.16 vr represents the velocity
of rain and vb , the velocity of the bicycle, the
woman is riding. Both these velocities are with
respect to the ground. Since the woman is riding
a bicycle, the velocity of rain as experienced by

 

Fig. 4.16

her is the velocity of rain relative to the velocity
of the bicycle she is riding. That is vrb = vr— vb
