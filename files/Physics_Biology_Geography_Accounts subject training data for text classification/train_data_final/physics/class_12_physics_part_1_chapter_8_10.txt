Example 8.4 Light with an energy ﬂux of 18 W/cm2 falls on a non-
reﬂecting surface at normal incidence. If the surface has an area of
20 cm2, find the average force exerted on the surface during a 30
minute time span.

Solution
The total energy falling on the surface is

U = (18 W/cm2) x (20 cm2) x (30 x 60)
= 6.48 x 105J
Therefore, the total momentum delivered (for complete absorption) is

U 6.48X105J

How will your result be modiﬁed if the surface is a perfect reﬂector? ll:
Example 8.5 Calculate the electric and magnetic ﬁelds produced by
the radiation coming from a 100 W bulb at a distance of 3 m. Assume
that the efficiency of the bulb is 2.5% and it is a point source.
Solution The bulb, as a point source, radiates light in all directions
uniformly. At a distance of 3 m, the surface area of the surrounding
sphere is
A = 4m2 = 4mg)2 = 113m2
The intensity I at this distance is
I _ Power _ 100W x 2.5%
Area 113 m2
= 0.022 W/m2
Half of this intensity is provided by the electric field and half by the
magnetic field.

(8.85 x 10‘ )(3 x 108)
= 2.9 V/m
The value of E found above is the root mean square value of the
electric field. Since the electric field in a light beam is sinusoidal, the
peak electric field, E0 is
E0 = JiEms = J5 >< 2.9V/m m
= 4.07 V/m g
Thus, you see that the electric field strength of the light that you use E
for reading is fairly large. Compare it with electric field strength of CD
TV or FM waves, which is of the order of a few microvolts per metre. 51
