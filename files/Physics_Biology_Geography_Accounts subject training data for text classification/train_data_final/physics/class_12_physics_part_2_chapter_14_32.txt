14.13 You are given two circuits as shown in Fig. 14.38, which consist
of NAND gates. Identify the logic operation carried out by the two

circuits.

A A
Y Y
B B

14.14 Write the truth table for circuit given in Fig. 14.39 below consisting
of NOR gates and identify the logic operation (OR, AND, NOT) which
this circuit is performing.

A A

B B

(Hint: A = 0, B = 1 then A and B inputs of second NOR gate will be 0
and hence Y=1. Similarly work out the values of Y for other
combinations of A and B. Compare with the truth table of OR, AND,

NOT gates and ﬁnd the correct one.)

14. 15 Write the truth table for the circuits given in Fig. 14.40 consisting of
NOR gates only. Identify the logic operations (OR, AND, NOT) performed

by the two circuits.
