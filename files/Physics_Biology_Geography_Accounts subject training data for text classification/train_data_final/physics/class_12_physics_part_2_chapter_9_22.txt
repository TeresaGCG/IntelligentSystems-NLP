In the quadrilateral AQNR, two of the angles
(at the vertices Q and R) are right angles.
Therefore, the sum of the other angles of the
quadrilateral is 180°.

AA + AQNR = 180°
From the triangle QNR,
r1 + r2 +AQNR = 180°
Comparing these two equations, we get

 

 

r1 + r2 = A (9.34) B C
The total deviation 6 is the sum of deviations FIGURE 923 A my 01‘ light passing through

6=(i—r1)+(e—r2)
that is,
5 = i+ e—A (9.35)

Thus, the angle of deviation depends on the angle of incidence. A plot
between the angle of deviation and angle of incidence is shown in
Fig. 9.24. You can see that, in general, any given value of 6, except for
i= e, corresponds to two values iand hence of e. This, in fact, is expected
from the symmetry of i and e in Eq. (9.35), i.e., 6 remains the same if i
and e are interchanged. Physically, this is related
to the fact that the path of ray in Fig. 9.23 can be

experimentally. Equation (9.38) thus provides a
method of determining refractive index of the material of the prism.
For a small angle prism, i.e., a thin prism, Dm is also very small, and
we get

Dm = (n21—1)A
It implies that, thin prisms do not deviate light much. 33 1
