i Physics

one of the two bars is a magnet, pick up one, (say, A) and lower one of
its ends; first on one of the ends of the other (say, B), and then on the
middle of B. If you notice that in the middle of B, A experiences no
force, then B is magnetised. If you do not notice any change from the

end to the middle of B, then A is magnetised.

5.2.4 The electrostatic analog

Comparison of Eqs. (5.2), (5.3) and (5.6) with the corresponding equations
for electric dipole (Chapter 1), suggests that magnetic ﬁeld at large
distances due to a bar magnet of magnetic moment m can be obtained
from the equation for electric ﬁeld due to an electric dipole of dipole moment
p, by making the following replacements:

In particular, we can write down the equatorial ﬁeld (BE) of a bar magnet
at a distance r, for r >> 1, where lis the size of the magnet:

Likewise, the axial ﬁeld (B A) of a bar magnet for r >> lis:

Equation (5.8) is just Eq. (5.2) in the vector form. Table 5. 1 summarises
the analogy between electric and magnetic dipoles.

Example 5.4 What is the magnitude of the equatorial and axial fields
due to a bar magnet of length 5.0 cm at a distance of 50 cm from its
mid-point? The magnetic moment of the bar magnet is 0.40 A m2, the
same as in Example 5.2.
