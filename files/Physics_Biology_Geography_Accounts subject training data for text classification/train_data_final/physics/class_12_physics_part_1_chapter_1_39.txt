EXAMPLE 1.13

 

The ﬂux through the Gaussian surface, calculated as before, is

E X 4 TE r2. However, in this case, the Gaussian surface encloses no

charge. Gauss’s law then gives

E x 4 a: r2 = 0

i.e., E=O (r<R) (1.35)
that is, the ﬁeld due to a uniformly charged thin shell is zero at all points
inside the shell*. This important result is a direct consequence of Gauss’s
law which follows from Coulomb’s law. The experimental veriﬁcation of
this result confirms the l / r2 dependence in Coulomb’s law.

Example 1.13 An early model for an atom considered it to have a
positively charged point nucleus of charge Ze, surrounded by a
uniform density of negative charge up to a radius R. The atom as a
whole is neutral. For this model, what is the electric field at a distance
r from the nucleus?

Solution The charge distribution for this model of the atom is as
shown in Fig. 1.32. The total negative charge in the uniform spherical
charge distribution of radius R must be —Z e, since the atom (nucleus
of charge Z 6 + negative charge) is neutral. This immediately gives us
the negative charge density p, since we must have

To find the electric field E(r) at a point P which is a distance r away
from the nucleus, we use Gauss’s law. Because of the spherical
symmetry of the charge distribution, the magnitude of the electric
field E(r) depends only on the radial distance, no matter what the
direction of r. Its direction is along (or opposite to) the radius vector 1'
from the origin to the point P. The obvious Gaussian surface is a
spherical surface centred at the nucleus. We consider two situations,
namely, r < R and r > R.

(i) r < R : The electric ﬂux g1) enclosed by the spherical surface is

4) = E (r) X 4 n r2
where E (r) is the magnitude of the electric field at r. This is because
