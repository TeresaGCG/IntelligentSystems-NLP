Electric Charges
and Fields

Notice the important point that the dipole field at large distances
falls off not as l / r2 but asl / r3. Further, the magnitude and the direction
of the dipole ﬁeld depends not only on the distance r but also on the
angle between the position vector 1' and the dipole moment p.

We can think of the limit when the dipole size 2a approaches zero,
the charge q approaches infinity in such a way that the product
p = q X 2a is finite. Such a dipole is referred to as a point dipole. For a
point dipole, Eqs. (1.20) and (1.2 l) are exact, true for any r.

1.1 1.2 Physical signiﬁcance of dipoles

In most molecules, the centres of positive charges and of negative charges*
lie at the same place. Therefore, their dipole moment is zero. CO2 and
CH 4 are of this type of molecules. However, they develop a dipole moment
when an electric field is applied. But in some molecules, the centres of
negative charges and of positive charges do not coincide. Therefore they
have a permanent electric dipole moment, even in the absence of an electric
field. Such molecules are called polar molecules. Water molecules, H2O,
is an example of this type. Various materials give rise to interesting
properties and important applications in the presence or absence of

electric field.

Example 1.10 Two charges :10 iiC are placed 50 mm apart.
Determine the electric field at (a) a point P on the axis of the dipole
15 cm away from its centre 0 on the side of the positive charge, as
shown in Fig. 1.21(a), and (b) a point Q, 15 cm away from O on a line
passing through 0 and normal to the axis of the dipole, as shown in
Fig. 1.21(b).
