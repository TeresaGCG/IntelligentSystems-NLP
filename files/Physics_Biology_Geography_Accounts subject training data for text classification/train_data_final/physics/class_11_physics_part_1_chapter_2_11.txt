Example 2.9 The resistance R = V/ I where
V= (100 i SW and 1= (10 i 0.2)A. Find the

percentage error in R.

 

Answer The percentage error in Vis 5% and in
I it is 2%. The total error in R would therefore
be 5% + 2% = 7%. 4

Example 2.1 0 Two resistors of resistances
R1: 100 $3 ohm and R2 = 200 i 4 ohm are
connected (a) in series. (b) in parallel. Find
the equivalent resistance of the (a) series

combination. (b) parallel combination. Use
for (a) the relation R =R] + R2. and for (b)

Answer (a) The equivalent resistance of series
combination

R =R1+ R2: (100 i 3) ohm + (200 i 4) ohm

= 300: 7ohm.

(b) The equivalent resistance of parallel
combination

R,= R1R2 = 200
R1 + R2 3 = 66.7 Ohm

Then, R’= 66.7i1.8 ohm

(Here, AR is expresed as 1.8 instead of 2 to
keep in confirmity with the rules of significant
figures.) 4

(c) Error in case of a measured quantity
raised to a power

Suppose Z =A2,

Then,

AZ/Z= (AA/A) + (AA/A) = 2 (AA/A).
Hence, the relative error in A2 is two times the
error in A.

In general, if Z = AP Bq/C’
Then,
AZ/Z= p (AA/A) + q (AB/B) + r (AC/C).

Hence the rule : The relative error in a
physical quantity raised to the power k is the
k times the relative error in the individual
quantity.

 

Answer The relative error in Z is AZ/Z =
4(AA/A) +(1/3) (AB/B) + (AC/C) + (3/2) (AD/D).

Example 2.1 2 The period of oscillation of

a simple pendulum is T=27c,/L/g.
Measured value of Lie 20.0 cm known to 1

mm accuracy and time for 100 oscillations
of the pendulum is found to be 90 s using
a wrist watch of 1 5 resolution. What is the

 

accuracy in the determination of g ?

Answer 9 = 47:2L/T2

t At AT At

Here, T= — and AT=— . Therefore, —=—.
n n T t

The errors in both L and t are the least count
errors. Therefore,
(Ag/g) = (AL/ L) + 2(AT/ T)

= &+Z(i)=0.027
20.0 90

Thus, the percentage error in g is
100 (Ag/g) = 100(AL/L) + 2 x 100 (AT/T)
= 3% 4

2.7 SIGNIFICANT FIGURES

As discussed above, every measurement
involves errors. Thus, the result of
measurement should be reported in a way that
indicates the precision of measurement.
Normally, the reported result of measurement
is a number that includes all digits in the
number that are known reliably plus the first
digit that is uncertain. The reliable digits plus
