return after reﬂection at the Moon’s surface. How much is the radius of the lunar
orbit around the Earth ?

2.30 A SONAR [sound navigation and ranging) uses ultrasonic waves to detect and locate
objects under water. In a submarine equipped with a SONAR, the time delay between
generation of a probe wave and the reception of its echo after reﬂection from an
enemy submarine is found to be 77.0 s. What is the distance of the enemy submarine?
(Speed of sound in water = 1450 m s4].

2.3 1 The farthest objects in our Universe discovered by modern astronomers are so distant
that light emitted by them takes billions of years to reach the Earth. These objects
[known as quasars] have many puzzling features, which have not yet been satisfactorily
explained. What is the distance in km of a quasar from which light takes 3.0 billion
years to reach us ?

2.32 It is a well known fact that during a total solar eclipse the disk of the moon almost
completely covers the disk of the Sun. From this fact and from the information you
can gather from examples 2.3 and 2.4, determine the approximate diameter of the
moon.

2.33 A great physicist of this century [P.A.M. Dirac] loved playing with numerical values of
Fundamental constants of nature. This led him to an interesting observation. Dirac
found that from the basic constants of atomic physics (0, e, mass of electron, mass of
proton] and the gravitational constant G, he could arrive at a number with the
dimension of time. Further, it was a very large number, its magnitude being close to
the present estimate on the age of the universe [~15 billion years]. From the table of
fundamental constants in this book, try to see if you too can construct this number
[or any other interesting number you can think of ]. If its coincidence with the age of
the universe were significant, what would this imply for the constancy of fundamental
constants?
