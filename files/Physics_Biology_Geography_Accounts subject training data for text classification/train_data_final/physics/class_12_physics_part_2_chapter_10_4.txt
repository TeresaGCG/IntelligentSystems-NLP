10.3 REFRACTION AND REFLECTION OF
PLANE WAVES USING HUYGENS
PRINCIPLE

10.3.1 Refraction of a plane wave

We will now use Huygens principle to derive the laws of
refraction. Let PP' represent the surface separating medium
1 and medium 2, as shown in Fig. 10.4. Let v1 and 02
represent the speed of light in medium 1 and medium 2,
respectively. We assume a plane wavefront AB propagating
in the direction A’A incident on the interface at an angle i
as shown in the ﬁgure. Let r be the time taken by the
wavefront to travel the distance BC. Thus,

BC=vlr

FIGURE 10.4 A plane wave AB is incident at an angle 1'
on the surface PP’ separating medium 1 and medium 2.
The plane wave undergoes refraction and CE represents
the refracted wavefront. The figure corresponds to v2 < vl
so that the refracted waves bends towards the normal.

Christiaan Huygens
[1629 - 1.69.5.1 Dutch
physicist, astronomer,
mathematiCiari .and the
founder of the wave
theory of‘rlight. His book,

. Treatise; on light, makes

”fascinating reading even

“toay. He brilliantly

eiplained the double
refraction shown by the
mineral calcite in this
work in addition to
reﬂection and refraction.
He was the first to
analyse circular and
simple harmonic motion
and designed and built
improved clocks and
telescopes. He discovered
the true geometry of
Saturn’s rings.

In order to determine the shape of the refracted wavefront, we draw a

sphere of radius 021: from the point A in the second medium (the speed of
the wave in the second medium is 02). Let CE represent a tangent plane
drawn from the point C on to the sphere. Then, AE = 02 r and CE would
represent the refracted wavefront. If we now consider the triangles ABC
and AEC, we readily obtain

where iand r are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively. 355
