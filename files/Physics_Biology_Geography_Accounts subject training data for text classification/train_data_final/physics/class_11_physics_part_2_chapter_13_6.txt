Founders of Kinetic Theory of Gases

James Clerk Maxwell (1831 — 1879). born in Edinburgh.

Scotland. was among the greatest physicists of the nineteenth
century. He derived the thermal velocity distribution of molecules
in a gas and was among the first to obtain reliable estimates of
molecular parameters from measurable quantities like viscosity.
etc. Maxwell's greatest achievement was the unification of the laws
of electricity and magnetism (discovered by Coulomb. Oersted.
Ampere and Faraday) into a consistent set of equations now called
Maxwell's equations. From these he arrived at the most important
conclusion that light is an
electromagnetic wave.
Interestingly. Maxwell did not
agree with the idea [strongly
suggested by the Faraday's
laws of electrolysis] that
electricity was particulate in
nature.

Ludwig Boltzmann

(1844 — 1906) born in

Vienna. Austria. worked on the kinetic theory of gases

independently of Mamvell. A firm advocate of atomism. that is

basic to kinetic theory. Boltzmann provided a statistical

interpretation of the Second Law of thermodynamics and the

concept of entropy. He is regarded as one of the founders of classical

statistical mechanics. The proportionality constant connecting

energy and temperature in kinetic theory is known as Boltzmann's
constant in his honour.
