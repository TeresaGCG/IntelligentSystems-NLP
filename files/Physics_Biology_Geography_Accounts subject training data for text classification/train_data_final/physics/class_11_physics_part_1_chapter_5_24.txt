A monkey of mass 40 kg climbs on a rope (Fig. 5.20) which
can stand a maximum tension of 600 N. In which of the
following cases will the rope break: the monkey m
(a) climbs up with an acceleration of 6 m s‘2 ‘
(b) climbs down with an acceleration of 4 m s‘2

(c) climbs up with a uniform speed of 5 m s‘1

[d] falls down the rope nearly freely under gravity?
(Ignore the mass of the rope). Fig. 5-20

 

Two bodies A and B of masses 5 kg and 10 kg in contact with
each other rest on a table against a rigid wall (Fig. 5.2 l). The
coefficient of friction between the bodies and the table is
0.15. A force of 200 N is applied horizontally to A. What are
[a] the reaction of the partition [b] the action—reaction forces
between A and B ? What happens when the wall is removed? 20° N
Does the answer to (b) change, when the bodies are in motion?
Ignore the difference between us and pk. Fig. 5,21

  
 

A block of mass 15 kg is placed on a long trolley. The coefficient of static friction
between the block and the trolley is 0.18. The trolley accelerates from rest with
0.5 m s2 for 20 s and then moves with uniform velocity. Discuss the motion of the
block as viewed by [a] a stationary observer on the ground, [b] an observer moving with
the trolley.

The rear side of a truck is open and a box of 40 kg
mass is placed 5 m away from the open end as shown
in Fig. 5.22. The coefficient of friction between the
box and the surface below it is 0.15. On a straight
road, the truck starts from rest and accelerates with
2 m s‘2. At what distance from the starting point
does the box fall off the truck? (Ignore the size of
the box).

 

 

 

 

A disc revolves with a speed of 33% rev/ min, and has a radius of 15 cm. Two coins are

placed at 4 cm and 14 cm away from the centre of the record. If the co—efficient of friction
between the coins and the record is 0. l 5, which of the coins will revolve with the record ?

You may have seen in a circus a motorcyclist driving in vertical loops inside a ‘death—
well’ (a hollow spherical chamber with holes, so the spectators can watch from outside).
Explain clearly why the motorcyclist does not drop down when he is at the uppermost
point, with no support from below. What is the minimum speed required at the
uppermost position to perform a vertical loop if the radius of the chamber is 25 m ?

A 70 kg man stands in contact against the inner wall of a hollow cylindrical drum of
radius 3 m rotating about its vertical axis with 200 rev/ min. The coefficient of
friction between the wall and his clothing is 0.15. What is the minimum rotational
speed of the cylinder to enable the man to remain stuck to the wall [without falling]
when the ﬂoor is suddenly removed ?

A thin circular loop of radius R rotates about its vertical diameter with an angular
frequency a). Show that a small bead on the wire loop remains at its lowermost point

for w s V[g / R . What is the angle made by the radius vector joining the centre to
the bead with the vertical downward direction for a) : V’29 / R ? Neglect friction.
