,B-rays are electrons. yhrays are electromagnetic radiation of wavelengths
shorter than X-rays;

Law of radioactive decay : N (t) = M0) 6"“

where )1 is the decay constant or disintegration constant

The half- life T /2 of a radionuclide is the time in which N has been
reduced to one- -half of its initial value The mean hfe 1' is the time at
which N has been reduced to e‘1 of its initial value

T1,2 =1n72=11n2

Energy is released when less tightly bound nuclei are transmuted into
more tightly bound nuclei. In ﬁssion, a heavy nucleus like 2:5 2U breaks
into two smaller fragments, e.g., 2325 U+gn #3? Sb + 2? Nb + 4 oﬁ:

The fact that more neutrons are produced in ﬁssion than are ydﬁsﬂmed
gives the possibility of a chain reaction with each neutron that is
produced triggering another ﬁssion The chain reaction is 1:111controlled
and rapid in a nuclear bomb explosion It is controlled and steady in
a nuclear reactor In a reactor, the value ogthe neutron multiplication
factor k is maintained at 1

POINTS TO PONDER

The density of nuclear matter is independent of the size of the nucleus.
The mass density of the atom does not follow this rule.

The radius of a nucleus determined by electron scattering is found to
be slightly different from that determined by alpha-particle scattering.
