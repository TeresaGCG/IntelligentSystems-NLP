Moving Charges and

Magnetism

 

(iv) There exists a simple rule to determine the direction of the magnetic
ﬁeld due to a long wire. This rule, called the right-hand rule*, is:
Grasp the wire in your right hand with your extended thumb pointing

in the direction of the current. Your fingers will curl around in the

direction of the magnetic field.

Ampere’s circuital law is not new in content from Biot-Savart law.
Both relate the magnetic ﬁeld and the current, and both express the same
physical consequences of a steady electrical current. Ampere’s law is to
Biot—Savart law, what Gauss’s law is to Coulomb’s law. Both, Ampere’s
and Gauss’s law relate a physical quantity on the periphery or boundary
(magnetic or electric ﬁeld) to another physical quantity, namely, the source,
in the interior (current or charge). We also note that Ampere’s circuital
law holds for steady currents which do not ﬂuctuate with time. The
following example will help us understand what is meant by the term
enclosed current.

Example 4.8 Figure 4.15 shows a long straight wire of a circular
cross-section (radius a) carrying steady current I. The current I is
uniformly distributed across this cross-section. Calculate the
magnetic field in the region r < a and r > a.

 

FIGURE 4. 15

Solution (a) Consider the case r > a. The Amperian loop, labelled 2,
is a circle concentric with the cross-section. For this loop,

L = 2 7: r

1‘a = Current enclosed by the loop = I

The result is the familiar expression for a long straight wire

B (27: r) = #01

 

B: #01

r (r>a)

(b) Consider the case r < a. The Amperian loop is a circle labelled 1.
For this loop, taking the radius of the circle to be r,

L=21tr

* Note that there are two distinct right—hand rules: One which gives the direction
of B on the axis of current—loop and the other which gives direction of B
for a straight conducting wire. Fingers and thumb play different roles in
the two.
