4.7. 1 Position Vector and Displacement

The position vector 1' of a particle P located in a
plane with reference to the origin of an x—y
reference frame (Fig. 4.12) is given by

r = x i + y}
where xand y are components of 1' along x—, and

y- axes or simply they are the coordinates of
the object.

Fig. 4. 1 3 As the time intervalAt approaches zero, the average velocity approaches the velocity v. The direction
of IV is parallel to the line tangent to the path.

Suppose a particle moves along the curve shown
by the thick line and is at P at time tand P’ at
time t’ [Fig 4.12(b)]. Then, the displacement is :

Ar = r’ — r (4.25)
and is directed from P to P’ .

We can write Eq. (4.25) in a component form:
Ar = (x’i+y’i)—(xi+yi)
= iAx + iAy
where Ax = x’ — x, Ay = y’ — y (4.26)
Velocity

The average velocity (V) of an object is the ratio

of the displacement and the corresponding time
interval :

Since V = E , the direction of the average velocity

is the same as that of Ar (Fig. 4. 12). The velocity
(instantaneous velocity) is given by the limiting
value of the average velocity as the time interval
approaches zero :

The meaning of the limiting process can be easily
understood with the help of Fig 4.13(a) to (d). In
these figures, the thick line represents the path
of an object, which is at P at time t. P1. P2 and
P3 represent the positions of the object after
times At1,At2, and Ats. Arl, Arz, and Ar3 are the

displacements of the object in times Atl, M2, and
