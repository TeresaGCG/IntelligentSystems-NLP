6. 1 The sign of work done by a force on a body is important to understand. State carefully
if the following quantities are positive or negative:
[a] work done by a man in lifting a bucket out of a well by means of a rope tied to the

6.2

6.3

bucket.

[b] work done by gravitational force in the above case,

[c] work done by friction on a body
sliding down an inclined plane,

[d] work done by an applied force on
a body moving on a rough
horizontal plane with uniform
velocity,

[e] work done by the resistive force of
air on a vibrating pendulum in
bringing it to rest.

A body of mass 2 kg initially at rest

moves under the action of an applied

horizontal force of 7 N on a table with

coefficient of kinetic friction = 0.1.

Compute the

[a] work done by the applied force in
10 s,

[b] work done by friction in 10 s,

[c] work done by the net force on the
body in 10 s,

[d] change in kinetic energy of the
body in 10 s,

and interpret your results.

Given in Fig. 6.1 l are examples of some
potential energy functions in one
dimension. The total energy of the
particle is indicated by a cross on the
ordinate axis. In each case, specify the
regions, if any, in which the particle
cannot be found for the given energy.
Also, indicate the minimum total
energy the particle must have in each
case. Think of simple physical contexts
for which these potential energy shapes
are relevant.
