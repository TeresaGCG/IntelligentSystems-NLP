and the potential difference V0 is

V0 = Eod
The capacitance CO in this case is

C0 — V0 ‘80 a [2-46)

Consider next a dielectric inserted between the plates fully occupying
the intervening region. The dielectric is polarised by the ﬁeld and, as
explained in Section 2.10, the effect is equivalent to two charged sheets
(at the surfaces of the dielectric normal to the field) with surface charge
densities 0p and —0p. The electric field in the dielectric then corresponds
to the case when the net surface charge density on the plates is i(0— 0p).
That is,

 

 

0' — 0'
E = P (2.47)

so that the potential difference across the plates is
0' — 0'
V = E d = P d
80 (2.48)

For linear dielectrics, we expect GP to be proportional to E , i.e., to 0.
Thus, (0— Up) is proportional to 0 and we can write

a—o‘P =— (2.49)

where K is a constant characteristic of the dielectric. Clearly, K > 1. We
then have

The capacitance C, with dielectric between the plates, is then
_ Q _ EOKA
— V d (2.5 1)

The product 80K is called the permittivity of the medium and is
denoted by 8
e = 80 K (2.52)
For vacuum K = 1 and 8 = £0; 80 is called the permittivity of the vacuum
The dimensionless ratio

K = —

is called the dielectric constant of the substance. As remarked before,
from Eq. (2.49), it is clear that K is greater than 1. From Eqs. (2.46) and
(2. 5 1)

Thus, the dielectric constant of a substance is the factor (> 1) by which
the capacitance increases from its vacuum value, when the dielectric is
inserted fully between the plates of a capacitor. Though we arrived at
