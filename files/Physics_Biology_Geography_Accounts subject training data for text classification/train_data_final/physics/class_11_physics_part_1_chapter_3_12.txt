initial velocity increases the stopping distance
by a factor of 4 (for the same deceleration).

For the car of a particular make, the braking
distance was found to be 10 m, 20 m, 34 m and
50 m corresponding to velocities of l 1, 15, 20
and 25 m/s which are nearly consistent with
the above formula.

Stopping distance is an important factor
considered in setting speed limits, for example,
in school zones. 4

F Example 3.8 Reaction time : When a
situation demands our immediate
action, it takes some time before we
really respond. Reaction time is the
time a person takes to observe, think
and act. For example. if a person is
driving and suddenly a boy appears on
the road. then the time elapsed before
he slams the brakes of the car is the
reaction time. Reaction time depends

on complexity of the situation and on
an individual.

You can measure your reaction time
by a simple experiment. Take a ruler
and ask your friend to drop it vertically
through the gap between your thumb
and forefinger (Fig. 3.15). After you
catch it. find the distance d travelled
by the ruler. In a particular case, (1 was
found to be 21.0 cm. Estimate reaction

time.

Answer The ruler drops under free fall.
Therefore, v0 = O, and a = —g = —9.8 m s”. The

3.7 RELATIVE VELOCITY

 

You must be familiar with the experience of
travelling in a train and being overtaken by
another train moving in the same direction as
you are. While that train must be travelling faster
than you to be able to pass you, it does seem
slower to you than it would be to someone
standing on the ground and watching both the
trains. In case both the trains have the same
velocity with respect to the ground, then to you
the other train would seem to be not moving at
all. To understand such observations, we now
introduce the concept of relative velocity.

Consider two objects A and B moving
uniformly with average velocities vA and DB in
one dimension, say along x-axis. (Unless
otherwise specified, the velocities mentioned in
this chapter are measured with reference to the
ground). Ifo (0) and xB (O) are positions of objects
A and B, respectively at time t = 0, their positions
xA (t) and xB (t) at time tare given by:

xA (t) xA(O) + vA t (3.12a)
xB (t) xB(O) + vBt (3.12b)

Then, the displacement from object A to object
B is given by

xBA(t) = x8 (t) — xA (t)
=1x,,(0)— x,(0)1+(uB— DA) t. (3.13)

Equation (3.13) is easily interpreted. It tells us
that as seen from object A, object B has a
velocity vB— vA because the displacement from
A to B changes steadily by the amount vB— DA in
each unit of time. We say that the velocity of
object B relative to objectA is vB — vA :

— vA (3.14a)

vBA = DB

Similarly, velocity of object A relative to object B
is:
v = vA—vB (3.14b)
