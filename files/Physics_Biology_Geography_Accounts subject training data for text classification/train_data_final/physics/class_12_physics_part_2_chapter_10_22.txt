where f is the focal length of the lens and 2a is the diameter of the circular
aperture or the diameter of the lens, whichever is smaller. Typically if

Although the size of the spot is very small, it plays an important role
in determining the limit of resolution of optical instruments like a telescope
or a microscope. For the two stars to be just resolved

0.61/1

Thus A0 will be small if the diameter of the objective is large. This
implies that the telescope will have better resolving power if a is large. It
is for this reason that for better resolution, a telescope must have a large
diameter objective.

Example 10.6 Assume that light of wavelength 6000A is coming from
a star. What is the limit of resolution of a telescope whose objective
has a diameter of 100 inch?

Solution A 100 inch telescope implies that 2a = 100 inch
= 254 cm. Thus if,

x z 6000A = 6x 10‘5 cm
then

~ 0.61 X 6 x 10'5

We can apply a similar argument to the objective lens of a microscope.
In this case, the object is placed slightly beyond f, so that a real image is
formed at a distance D [Fig. 10.20]. The magnification (ratio of
image size to object size) is given by m z 0/ f. It can be seen from
Fig. 10.20 that

D/fz2 tanﬁ (10.26)
where 2[3 is the angle subtended by the diameter of the objective lens at
the focus of the microscope.
