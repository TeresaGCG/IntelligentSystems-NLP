Electrostatic Potential
and Capacitance

 

charge on each capacitor is then 9’ = CV’. By charge
conservation, Q’ = 9/2. This implies V’ = V/2. The total energy

of the system is = 2X%Q'V'= iQV =2.25x10*‘J

Thus in going from (a) to (b), though no charge is lost; the final
energy is only half the initial energy. Where has the remaining
energy gone?

There is a transient period before the system settles to the
situation (b). During this period, a transient current ﬂows from
the first capacitor to the second. Energy is lost during this time
in the form of heat and electromagnetic radiation.

SUMMARY

1. Electrostatic force is a conservative force. Work done by an external
force [equal and opposite to the electrostatic force) in bringing a charge
q from a point R to a point P is VP — VR, which is the difference in
potential energy of charge q between the final and initial points.

2. Potential at a point is the work done per unit charge [by an external
agency) in bringing a charge from infinity to that point. Potential at a
point is arbitrary to within an additive constant, since it is the potential
difference between two points which is physically significant. If potential
at infinity is chosen to be zero; potential at a point with position vector
r due to a point charge Q placed at the origin is given is given by

point dipole of dipole moment p placed at the origin is

The result is true also for a dipole [with charges —q and q separated by

4. For a charge configuration ql, q2, qn with position vectors r1,
r2, tn, the potential at a point P is given by the superposition principle

where r1P is the distance between q1 and P, as and so on.

5. An equipotential surface is a surface over which potential has a constant
value. For a point charge. concentric spheres centred at a location of the
charge are equipotential surfaces. The electric ﬁeld E at a point is
perpendicular to the equipotential surface through the point. E is in the
direction of the steepest decrease of potential.
