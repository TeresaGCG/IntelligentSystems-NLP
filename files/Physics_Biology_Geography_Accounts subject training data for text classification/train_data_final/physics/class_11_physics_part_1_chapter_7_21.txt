vary from one point of the body to the other. If
the body is so extended that g varies from part
to part of the body, then the centre of gravity
and centre of mass will not coincide. Basically,
the two are different concepts. The centre of
mass has nothing to do with gravity. It depends
only on the distribution of mass of the body.

In Sec. 7.2 we found out the position of the
centre of mass of several regular, homogeneous
objects. Obviously the method used there gives
us also the centre of gravity of these bodies, if
they are small enough.

Figure 7.25 illustrates another way of
determining the CG of an irregular shaped body
like a cardboard. If you suspend the body from
some point like A, the vertical line through A
passes through the CG. We mark the vertical
AAl. We then suspend the body through other
points like B and C. The intersection of the
verticals gives the CG. Explain why the method
works. Since the body is small enough, the
method allows us to determine also its centre
of mass.

bExample 7.8 A metal bar 70 cm long
and 4.00 kg in mass supported on two
knife-edges placed 10 cm from each end.
A 6.00 kg load is suspended at 30 cm from
one end. Find the reactions at the knife—
edges. (Assume the bar to be of uniform
cross section and homogeneous.)

 

Figure 7.26 shows the rod AB, the positions
of the knife edges K1 and K2 , the centre of
gravity of the rod at G and the suspended load
at P.

Note the weight of the rod W acts at its
centre of gravity G. The rod is uniform in cross
section and homogeneous; hence G is at the
centre of the rod; AB = 70 cm. AG = 35 cm, AP
= 30 cm, PG = 5 cm, AK1= BK2= 10 cm and KlG
= K2G = 25 cm. Also, W= weight of the rod =

4.00 kg and W1: suspended load = 6.00 kg;
R1 and R2 are the normal reactions of the
support at the knife edges.

For translational equilibrium of the rod,

R1+R2 —W1 —W = 0 (i)

Note W1 and W act vertically down and R1
and R2 act vertically up.

For considering rotational equilibrium, we
take moments of the forces. A convenient point
to take moments about is G. The moments of
R2 and W1 are anticlockwise (+ve), whereas the
moment of R1 is clockwise (-ve).

For rotational equilibrium,

—R1(K1G) + W1 (PG) + R2 (KZG) = 0 (ii)

It is given that W: 4.009 N and W1 = 6.009
N, where 9 = acceleration due to gravity. We
take 9 = 9.8 m/s2.

With numerical values inserted, from (i)

R1+ R2 — 4.009 — 6.009 = 0

or R1+ R2 = 10.009 N (iii)
= 98.00 N

From (ii), — 0.25 R1+ 0.05 W1+ 0.25 R2= 0
orRl—R2= 1.29 N= 11.76N (iv)

From (iii) and (iv), R1 = 54.88 N,

R2 = 43.12 N
Thus the reactions of the support are about
