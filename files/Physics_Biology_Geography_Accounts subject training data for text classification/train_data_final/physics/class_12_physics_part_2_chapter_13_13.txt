Nuclei

In both [3' and [F decay, the mass number A remains unchanged. In
ﬁ'decay, the atomic number Z of the nucleus goes up by 1, while in [3*
decay Z goes down by 1. The basic nuclear process underlying [3' decay
is the conversion of neutron to proton

n—>p+e‘+ 17 (13.24)
while for [3+ decay, it is the conversion of proton into neutron
p—>n+e++v (13.25)

Note that while a free neutron decays to proton, the decay of proton to
neutron [Eq. (13.25)] is possible only inside the nucleus, since proton
has smaller mass than neutron.

13.6.4 Gamma decay

Like an atom, a nucleus also has discrete energy levels - the ground
state and excited states. The scale of energy is, however, very different.
Atomic energy level spacings are of the order of eV, while the difference in
nuclear energy levels is of the order of MeV. When a
nucleus in an excited state spontaneously decays
to its ground state (or to a lower energy state), a
photon is emitted with energy equal to the difference
in the two energy levels of the nucleus. This is the
so-called gamma decay. The energy (MeV)
corresponds to radiation of extremely short

 

E: 1.17 MeV

wavelength, shorter than the hard X-ray region.
Typically, a gamma ray is emitted when a 01 or B E7 = 1.33 MeV
decay results in a daughter nucleus in an excited

state. This then returns to the ground state by a
single photon transition or successive transitions
involving more than one photon. A familiar example
is the successive emmission of gamma rays of
energies 1 . 17 MeV and 1.33 MeV from the
deexcitation of 3g N1 nuclei formed from [3' decay

13.7 NUCLEAR ENERGY

The curve of binding energy per nucleon Eb”, given in Fig. 13.1, has
a long ﬂat middle region between A = 30 and A = 170. In this region
the binding energy per nucleon is nearly constant (8.0 MeV). For
the lighter nuclei region, A < 30, and for the heavier nuclei region,
A > 170, the binding energy per nucleon is less than 8.0 MeV, as we
have noted earlier. Now, the greater the binding energy, the less is the
total mass of a bound system, such as a nucleus. Consequently, if nuclei
with less total binding energy transform to nuclei with greater binding
energy, there will be a net energy release. This is what happens when a
heavy nucleus decays into two or more intermediate mass fragments
(ﬁssion) or when light nuclei fuse into a havier nucleus (fusion)
Exothermic chemical reactions underlie conventional energy sources
such as coal or petroleum. Here the energies involved are in the range of
