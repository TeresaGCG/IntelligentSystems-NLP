SUMIWARY

Scalar quantities are quantities with magnitudes only. Examples are distance, speed,
mass and temperature.
Vector quantities are quantities with magnitude and direction both. Examples are
displacement, velocity and acceleration. They obey special rules of vector algebra.
A vector A multiplied by a real number 7L is also a vector, whose magnitude is 7L times
the magnitude of the vector A and whose direction is the same or opposite depending
upon whether 7L is positive or negative.
Two vectors A and B may be added graphically using head—tatail method or parallelogram
method.
Vector addition is commutative :

A + B = B + A
It also obeys the associative law :

[A+B)+C=A+[B+C]
A null or zero vector is a vector with zero magnitude. Since the magnitude is zero, we
don’t have to specify its direction. It has the properties :

A+0=A
7L0=0
0A=0

The subtraction of vector B from A is defined as the sum of A and —B :
A — B = A+ [—B}
A vector A can be resolved into component along two given vectors a and b lying in the
same plane :
A=la+ub
where 7L and u are real numbers.
A unit vector associated with a vector A has magnitude 1 and is along the vector A:

- A
n = ——
IA!
The unit vectors 3, 3, f; are vectors of unit magnitude and point in the direction of

the x—, y—, and z—axes, respectively in a right—handed coordinate system.
A vector A can be expressed as

A = Axi + ij
where Ax, Ay are its components along x—, and y —axes. If vector A makes an angle 6

Ay

2 2 _
with the x—axis, then Ax = A cos 0, Ay=A sin 6 and A 2 IA! 2 \le + Ay , tang A—

x

Vectors can be conveniently added using analytical method. If sum of two vectors A
and B, that lie in x—y plane, is R, then :

R: in+Ryj, where, Rx =Ax+Bx, and Ry =Ay + By

The position vector of an object in x—y plane is given by r = xi + y} and the
displacement from position 1' to position 1" is given by
Ar = r’— r

=(xC—x)i+(y5—y)3

= Ax ; + ij
If an object undergoes a displacement Ar in time At, its average velocity is given by
Ar
v = E. The velocity of an object at time t is the limiting value of the average velocity
