preferred in heavy-duty machines and in where the subscripts c and 3 refer to copper
structural designs. Wood, bone, concrete and and stainless steel respectively. Or,
glass have rather small Young’s moduli. ALC/ALS = (YS/YC) >< (LC/LS)
Given LC = 2.2 m. LS = 1.6 m,
Example 9.1 A structural steel rod has a From Table 9.1 YC = 1.1 x 1011 N.m‘2, and
radius of 10 mm and a length of 1.0 m. A YS = 2.0 x 1011 N.m‘2.
100 kN force stretches it along its length. ALC/ALS = (2.0 x loll/1.1 x 10”) x (2.2/1.6) = 2.5.
Calculate (a) stress. (b) elongation. and (c) The total elongation is given to be
strain on the rod. Young’s modulus. of ALC+ ALS = 7.0 x 10‘4m
structural steel is 2.0 x 10“ N m”. Solving the above equations,
ALC = 5.0 x 10'4 m, and ALS = 2.0 x 10'4 m.
Answer We assume that the rod is held by a Therefore
clamp at one end, and the force Fis applied at W = (A x YC >< ALCJ/LC

 

the other end, parallel to the length of the rod. = 7t (1.5 x 10'3)2 x [(5.0 x 10‘4 x 1.1 x 1011)/2.2]
Then the stress on the rod is given by = 1.8 x 102 N 4

A W circus, the entire weight of the balanced
100 x 103N group is supported by the legs of a

= 1.59 mm

The strain is given by
Strain = AL/L
= (1.59 x 10‘3 m)/(1m)
= 1.59 x 10‘3
= 0.16 % 4

Example 9.2 A copper wire of length 2.2
m and a steel wire of length 1.6 m. both of
diameter 3.0 mm. are connected end to end.

When stretched by a load. the net
elongation is found to be 0.70 mm. Obtain
the load applied.

Answer The copper and steel wires are under
a tensile stress because they have the same
tension (equal to the load W) and the same area
of cross-section A. From Eq. (9.7) we have stress
= strain >< Young’s modulus. Therefore

W/A = YC >< (ALc/Lc) = YS >< (ALS/LS) Fig. 9.5 Human pyramid in a circus.
