Fig. 7.21(b) The Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld exerts equal
and opposite forces on the poles of a
compass needle. These two forces form
a couple.

’ Example 7.7 Show that moment of a
couple does not depend on the point about
which you take the moments.

 

Fig. 7.22

Consider a couple as shown in Fig. 7 .22
acting on a rigid body. The forces F and -F act
respectively at points B and A. These points have
position vectors 1'1 and 1'2 with respect to origin
0. Let us take the moments of the forces about
the origin.

The moment of the couple = sum of the
moments of the two forces making the couple

=r1x (—F) + r2xF

=5xF—ng

= (1-2—1'1) x F

But r1 + AB = r2, and hence AB = r2 — 1-1.

The moment of the couple, therefore, is
AB x F.

Clearly this is independent of the origin, the
point about which we took the moments of the
forces. 4

7.8.1 Principle of moments

An ideal lever is essentially a light (i.e. of
negligible mass) rod pivoted at a point along its

length. This point is called the fulcrum. A see-
saw on the children’s playground is a typical
example of a lever. Two forces F1 and F2, parallel
to each other and usually perpendicular to the
lever, as shown here, act on the lever at
distances cl1 and d2 respectively from the
fulcrum as shown in Fig. 7.23.

The lever is a system in mechanical
equilibrium. Let R be the reaction of the support
at the fulcrum; R is directed opposite to the
forces F1 and F2. For translational equilibrium,

R—ﬁ—g=o m

For considering rotational equilibrium we
take the moments about the fulcrum; the sum
of moments must be zero,

le1 — d2F2 = 0 (ii)

Normally the anticlockwise (clockwise)
moments are taken to be positive (negative). Note
R acts at the fulcrum itself and has zero moment
about the fulcrum.

In the case of the lever force F1 is usually
some weight to be lifted. It is called the load
and its distance from the fulcrum d1 is called
the load arm. Force F2 is the effort applied to lift
the load; distance d2 of the effort from the
fulcrum is the effort arm.

Eq. (ii) can be written as

le1 = d2 F2 (7. 32a)

or load arm x load = effort arm x effort

The above equation expresses the principle
of moments for a lever. Incidentally the ratio
F1 /F2 is called the Mechanical Advantage (M.A.);

MA. = F2 d (7 .32b)

If the effort arm d2 is larger than the load
arm, the mechanical advantage is greater than
one. Mechanical advantage greater than one
means that a small effort can be used to lift a
large load. There are several examples of a lever
around you besides the see-saw. The beam of a
balance is a lever. Try to find more such
