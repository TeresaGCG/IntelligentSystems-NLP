The proof clearly goes through for any number of
capacitors arranged in a similar way. Equation (2.55),
for n capacitors arranged in series, generalises to

V=V1+V2+...+Vn=Q+g+m+g (2.59)

Following the same steps as for the case of two

capacitors, we get the general formula for effective

capacitance of a series combination of n capacitors:

2. 14.2 Capacitors in parallel

Figure 2.28 (a) shows two capacitors arranged in
parallel. In this case, the same potential difference is
applied across both the capacitors. But the plate charges
(:91) on capacitor 1 and the plate charges (iQZ) on the
capacitor 2 are not necessarily the same:

Q1 = ClV, Q2 = C2V (2.61)
The equivalent capacitor is one with charge

Q = 91 + 92 (2.62)
and potential difference V.

Q = CV= ClV+ C2V (2.63)
The effective capacitance C is, from Eq. (2.63),

C = C1 + C2 (2.64)

The general formula for effective capacitance C for
parallel combination of n capacitors [Fig. 2.28 (b)]
follows similarly,

Q=Q1+Q2+...+Qn (2.65)

i.e., CV= ClV+ C2V+ CnV (2.66)

which gives

C=C1+C2+...C (2.67)

Example 2.9 A network of four 10 HF capacitors is connected to a 500 V
supply, as shown in Fig. 2.29. Determine (a) the equivalent capacitance
of the network and (b) the charge on each capacitor. (Note, the charge
on a capacitor is the charge on the plate with higher potential, equal
and opposite to the charge on the plate with lower potential.)
