Example 6.4

Figure 6.7 shows planar loops of different shapes moving out of or
into a region of a magnetic field which is directed normal to the plane
of the loop away from the reader. Determine the direction of induced
current in each loop using Lenz’s law.

 

FIGURE 6.7

Solution

(i) The magnetic ﬂux through the rectangular loop abcd increases,
due to the motion of the loop into the region of magnetic field, The
induced current must ﬂow along the path bcdab so that it opposes
the increasing ﬂux.

(ii) Due to the outward motion, magnetic ﬂux through the triangular
loop abc decreases due to which the induced current ﬂows along
bacb, so as to oppose the change in ﬂux.

(iii) As the magnetic ﬂux decreases due to motion of the irregular
shaped loop abcd out of the region of magnetic field, the induced
current ﬂows along cdabc, so as to oppose change in ﬂux.

Note that there are no induced current as long as the loops are
completely inside or outside the region of the magnetic ﬁeld.

Example 6.5

(a) A closed loop is held stationary in the magnetic field between the
north and south poles of two permanent magnets held ﬁxed. Can
we hope to generate current in the loop by using very strong
magnets?

(b) A closed loop moves normal to the constant electric field between
the plates of a large capacitor. Is a current induced in the loop
(i) when it is wholly inside the region between the capacitor plates
(ii) when it is partially outside the plates of the capacitor? The
electric ﬁeld is normal to the plane of the loop.

(c) A rectangular loop and a circular loop are moving out of a uniform
magnetic field region (Fig. 6.8) to a field-free region with a constant
velocity v. In which loop do you expect the induced emf to be
constant during the passage out of the field region? The field is
normal to the loops.
