7.12 DYNAMICS OF ROTATIONAL MOTION
ABOUT A FIXED AXIS

Table 7 .2 lists quantities associated with linear
motion and their analogues in rotational motion.
We have already compared kinematics of the
two motions. Also, we know that in rotational
motion moment of inertia and torque play the
same role as mass and force respectively in
linear motion. Given this we should be able to
guess what the other analogues indicated in the
table are. For example, we know that in linear
motion, work done is given by F dx, in rotational

motion about a fixed axis it should be rdﬂ,
since we already know the correspondence
dx _> d0 and F _> 1- . It is, however, necessary

that these correspondences are established on
sound dynamical considerations. This is what
we now turn to.

Before we begin, we note a simpliﬁcation
that arises in the case of rotational motion
about a ﬁxed axis. Since the axis is fixed, only
those components of torques, which are along
the direction of the fixed axis need to be
considered in our discussion. Only these
components can cause the body to rotate about
the axis. A component of the torque
perpendicular to the axis of rotation will tend
to turn the axis from its position. We specifically
assume that there will arise necessary forces of
constraint to cancel the effect of the
perpendicular components of the (external)
torques, so that the fixed position of the axis
will be maintained. The perpendicular
components of the torques, therefore need not
be taken into account. This means that for our
calculation of torques on a rigid body:

(1) We need to consider only those forces that
lie in planes perpendicular to the axis.
Forces which are parallel to the axis will
give torques perpendicular to the axis and
need not be taken into account.

(2) We need to consider only those components
of the position vectors which are
perpendicular to the axis. Components of
position vectors along the axis will result in
torques perpendicular to the axis and need
not be taken into account.

Fig. 7.34 Work done by a force F1 acting on a particle
of a body rotating about a ﬁxed axis; the
particle describes a circular path with
centre C on the axis; arc P1P’1(ds1) gives
the displacement of the particle.

Figure 7 .34 shows a cross-section of a rigid
body rotating about a fixed axis, which is taken
as the z-axis (perpendicular to the plane of the
page; see Fig. 7.33). As said above we need to
consider only those forces which lie in planes
perpendicular to the axis. Let F1 be one such
typical force acting as shown on a particle of
the body at point P1 with its line of action in a
plane perpendicular to the axis. For convenience
we call this to be the x’—y’ plane (coincident
with the plane of the page). The particle at P1
describes a circular path of radius r1 with centre
C on the axis; CP1 = r1.

In time At, the point moves to the position
Pl’. The displacement of the particle dsl,
therefore, has magnitude ds1 = rlde and
direction tangential at P1 to the circular path
as shown. Here do is the angular displacement

of the particle, d0 = APICPI’ .The work done by

the force on the particle is
dW1 = F1. ds1= FldsI cos¢1= F1(r1d9)sin061
where ([51 is the angle between F1 and the tangent
