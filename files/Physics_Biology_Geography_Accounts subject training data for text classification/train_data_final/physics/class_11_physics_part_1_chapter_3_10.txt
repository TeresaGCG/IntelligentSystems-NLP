MOTION IN A STRAIGHT LINE

FIRST METHOD : In the first method, we split
the path in two parts : the upward motion (A to
B) and the downward motion (B to C) and
calculate the corresponding time taken t1 and
t2. Since the velocity at B is zero, we have :
v = D0 + at

O = 20 — 101:1

Or, t1 = 2 s

This is the time in going from A to B. From B, or
the point of the maximum height, the ball falls
freely under the acceleration due to gravity. The
ball is moving in negative y direction. We use
equation
1
y: y0 + vot+§at2
We have, y0 =45m, y=O, v0=0, a=—g =—lOmS'2
o = 45 +(1/2)(—10)t22

Solving, we get t2 = 3 s

Therefore, the total time taken by the ball before
ithitsthe ground: t1+ t2 = 2 s+ 3s =5 s.

SECOND METHOD : The total time taken can
also be calculated by noting the coordinates of
initial and final positions of the ball with respect
to the origin chosen and using equation

y=yO +v0t+éat2

Now y0=25m y=0m
vo=20ms4, a =—lOm S’Z, t = ?

O = 25 +20 t + (1/2) (-10) t2
Or, 5t2—20t —25 = 0

Solving this quadratic equation for t, we get
t = 5s

Note that the second method is better since we
do not have to worry about the path of the motion
as the motion is under constant acceleration.

Example 3.5 Free-fall : Discuss the
motion ofan object under free fall. Neglect

air resistance.

 

Answer An object released near the surface of
the Earth is accelerated downward under the
inﬂuence of the force of gravity. The magnitude
of acceleration due to gravity is represented by
g. If air resistance is neglected, the object is
said to be in free fall. If the height through
which the object falls is small compared to the
earth’s radius, 9 can be taken to be constant,
equal to 9.8 m S‘Z. Free fall is thus a case of
motion with uniform acceleration.

We assume that the motion is in y-direction,
more correctly in —y-direction because we
choose upward direction as positive. Since the
acceleration due to gravity is always downward,
it is in the negative direction and we have

a=—g =—9.8er2
The object is released from rest at y = 0. Therefore,
v0 = 0 and the equations of motion become:

v= O—gt =—9.8t ms*1
y=O—1/2gt2 =—4.9t2 m
v2=O—2gy =—19.6y m2s*2

These equations give the velocity and the
distance travelled as a function of time and also
the variation of velocity with distance. The
variation of acceleration, velocity, and distance,
with time have been plotted in Fig. 3. 14(a), (b)
and (c).
