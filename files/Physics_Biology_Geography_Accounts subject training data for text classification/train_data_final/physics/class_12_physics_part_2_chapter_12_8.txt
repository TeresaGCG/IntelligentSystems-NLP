For n = 4, one obtains the wavelength of HB line, etc. For n = oo, one obtains
the limit of the series, at A = 364.6 nm. This is the shortest wavelength in
the Balmer series. Beyond this limit, no further distinct lines appear,
instead only a faint continuous spectrum is seen.

Other series of spectra for hydrogen were subsequently discovered.
These are known, after their discoverers, as Lyman, Paschen, Brackett,
and Pfund series. These are represented by the formulae:

Lyman series:

1 1 1

12R 1—2_n—2 n=2,3,4... (12.6)
Paschen series:

1 1 1

12R y—g n=4,5,6... (12.7)
Brackett series:

1 1 1

12R 4—2—n—2 n=5,6,7... (12.8)

Pfund series:

1 1 1
12R 57—? n=6,7,8... (12.9)

The Lyman series is in the ultraviolet, and the Paschen and Brackett
series are in the infrared region.

The Balmer formula Eq. (12.5) may be written in terms of frequency
of the light, recalling that

C: v)»
L:
or [1 c
Thus, Eq. (12.5) becomes

There are only a few elements (hydrogen, singly ionised helium, and
doubly ionised lithium) whose spectra can be represented by simple
formula like Eqs. (12.5) — (12.9).

Equations (12.5) — (12.9) are useful as they give the wavelengths that
hydrogen atoms radiate or absorb. However, these results are empirical
and do not give any reasoning why only certain frequencies are observed
in the hydrogen spectrum.

12.4 BOHR MODEL OF THE HYDROGEN ATOM

The model of the atom proposed by Rutherford assumes that the atom,
consisting of a central nucleus and revolving electron is stable much like
sun-planet system which the model imitates. However, there are some
fundamental differences between the two situations. While the planetary
system is held by gravitational force, the nucleus-electron system being
charged objects, interact by Coulomb’s Law of force. We know that an
