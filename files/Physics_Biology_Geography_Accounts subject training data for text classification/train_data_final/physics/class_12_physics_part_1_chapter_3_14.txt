may be hundreds of miles away, via transmission cables. One obviously
wants to minimise the power loss in the transmission cables connecting
the power stations to homes and factories. We shall see now how this
can be achieved. Consider a device R, to which a power Pis to be delivered
via transmission cables having a resistance RC to be dissipated by it ﬁnally.
If Vis the voltage across R and I the current through it, then

P = VI (3.34)

The connecting wires from the power station to the device has a ﬁnite
resistance RC. The power dissipated in the connecting wires, which is
wasted is PC with

 

PC: 12 RC
P2 R
2 V2 C (3.35)

from Eq. (3.32). Thus, to drive a device of power P, the power wasted in the
connecting wires is inversely proportional to V2. The transmission cables
from power stations are hundreds of miles long and their resistance RC is
considerable. To reduce PC, these wires carry current at enormous values
of Vand this is the reason for the high voltage danger signs on transmission
lines — a common sight as we move away from populated areas. Using
electricity at such voltages is not safe and hence at the other end, a device
called a transformer lowers the voltage to a value suitable for use.

3.10 COMBINATION OF RESISTORS - SERIES AND
PARALLEL

The current through a single resistor R across which there is a potential
difference Vis given by Ohm’s law I = V/R. Resistors are sometimes joined
together and there are simple rules for calculation of equivalent resistance
of such combination.

Two resistors are said to be in series if only one of their end points is
joined (Fig. 3.13). If a third resistor is joined with the series combination
of the two (Fig. 3.14), then all three are said to be in series. Clearly, we
can extend this deﬁnition to series combination of any number of resistors.

Two or more resistors are said to be in parallel if one end of all the
resistors is joined together and similarly the other ends joined together
(Fig. 3.15).
