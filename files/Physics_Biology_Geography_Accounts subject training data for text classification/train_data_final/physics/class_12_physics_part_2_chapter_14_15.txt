bias, the current first increases very slowly, almost negligibly, till the
voltage across the diode crosses a certain value. After the characteristic
voltage, the diode current increases significantly (exponentially), even for
a very small increase in the diode bias voltage. This voltage is called the
threshold voltage or cut-in voltage (~O.2V for germanium diode and
~0.7 V for silicon diode).

For the diode in reverse bias, the current is very small (~uA) and almost
remains constant with change in bias. It is called reverse saturation
current. However, for special cases, at very high reverse bias (break down
voltage), the current suddenly increases. This special action of the diode
is discussed later in Section 14.8. The general purpose diode are not
used beyond the reverse saturation current region.

The above discussion shows that the p-n junction diode primerly
allows the ﬂow of current only in one direction (forward bias). The forward
bias resistance is low as compared to the reverse bias resistance. This
property is used for rectification of ac voltages as discussed in the next
section. For diodes, we define a quantity called dynamic resistance as
the ratio of small change in voltage AV to a small change in current AI:

Example 14.4 The V-I characteristic of a silicon diode is shown in
the Fig. 14.17. Calculate the resistance of the diode at (a) ID = 15 mA

and (b) VD = —10 V.

 

FIGURE 14.17

Solution Considering the diode characteristics as a straight line
between I = 10 mA to I = 20 mA passing through the origin, we can
calculate the resistance using Ohm’s law.
(a) From the curve, at I = 20 mA, V= 0.8 V; I = 10 mA, V= 0.7 V

rfb = AV/AI= 0.1V/1O mA = 10 9
(b) From the curve at V = —10 V, I = —1 (LA,

Therefore,

rrb= 10 V/lpA= 1.0 x 107 9
