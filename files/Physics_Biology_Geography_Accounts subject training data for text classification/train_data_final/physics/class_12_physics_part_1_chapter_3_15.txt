Consider two resistors R1 and R2 in series. The charge which leaves R1
must be entering R2. Since current measures the rate of ﬂow of charge,
this means that the same current I ﬂows through R1 and R2. By Ohm’s law:

Potential difference across R1 = V1 = I R1, and

Potential difference across R2 = V2 = I R2.
The potential difference Vacross the combination is V1+V2. Hence,
V= V1+ V2 = 1(R1 + R2) (3.36)

This is as if the combination had an equivalent resistance Reg, which
by Ohm’s law is

Req a; = (R1 + R2) (3.37)

If we had three resistors connected in series, then similarly

V=IR1 +IR2+IR3=I(R1+ R2+ R3). (3.38)

This obviously can be extended to a series combination of any number
n of resistors R1, R2 ..... , Rn. The equivalent resistance Req is

Req=R1+R2+...+R11 (3.39)

Consider now the parallel combination of two resistors (Fig. 3.15).
The charge that ﬂows in at A from the left ﬂows out partly through R1
and partly through R2. The currents I, 11, I2 shown in the figure are the
rates of ﬂow of charge at the points indicated. Hence,

I: 11 + 12 (3.40)

The potential difference between A and B is given by the Ohm’s law
applied to R1

V: 11 R1 (3.41)
Also, Ohm’s law applied to R2 gives
V: I2 R2 (3.42)
I — 11 + I2 — R1 R2 R1 R2 (3.43)

If the combination was replaced by an equivalent resistance Req, we
would have, by Ohm’s law

PL

—Req (3.44)
Hence,

Reg R1 R2 (3.45)

We can easily see how this extends to three resistors in parallel
(Fig. 3.16).
