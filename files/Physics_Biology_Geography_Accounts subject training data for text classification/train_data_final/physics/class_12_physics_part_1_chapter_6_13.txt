Electromagnetic
Induction
When the induced emf is non-zero, the current I is (in magnitude)
1 = E

The force required to keep the arm P9 in constant motion is I lB. Its
direction is to the left. In magnitude

One obtains similar expressions for the inward motion from x = 2b to E
x = 0. One can appreciate the Whole process by examining the sketch 9)
of various quantities displayed in Fig. 6.12(b). m 217
