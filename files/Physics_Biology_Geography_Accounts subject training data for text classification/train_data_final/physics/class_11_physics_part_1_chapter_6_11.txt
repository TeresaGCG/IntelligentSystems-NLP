= 1.25 x 104 J
We obtain

xm = 2.00 m

We note that we have idealised the situation.
The spring is considered to be massless. The
surface has been considered to possess
negligible friction. 4

We conclude this section by making a few
remarks on conservative forces.

(i) Information on time is absent from the above
discussions. In the example considered
above, we can calculate the compression, but
not the time over which the compression
occurs. A solution of Newton’s Second Law
for this system is required for temporal
information.

(ii) Not all forces are conservative. Friction, for
example, is a non-conservative force. The
principle of conservation of energy will have
to be modified in this case. This is illustrated
in Example 6.9.

(iii) The zero of the potential energy is arbitrary.
It is set according to convenience. For the
spring force we took V(x) = O, at x = O, i.e. the
unstretched spring had zero potential
energy. For the constant gravitational force
mg, we took V= O on the earth’s surface. In
a later chapter we shall see that for the force
due to the universal law of gravitation, the
zero is best defined at an infinite distance
from the gravitational source. However, once
the zero of the potential energy is fixed in a
given discussion, it must be consistently
adhered to throughout the discussion. You
cannot change horses in midstream !

 

> Example 6.9 Consider Example 6.8 taking
the coefﬁcient of friction. u. to be 0.5 and
calculate the maximum compression of the
spring.

 

Answer In presence of friction, both the spring
force and the frictional force act so as to oppose
the compression of the spring as shown in
Fig. 6.9.

We invoke the work-energy theorem, rather
than the conservation of mechanical energy.
The change in kinetic energy is

The work done by the net force is

W=—%kx,2n—/ngxm

Equating we have

émv2=ékxi+ymgxm

Now umg = 0.5 x 103x 10 = 5 x 103N (taking
9 =10.0 mS’Z). After rearranging the above
equation we obtain the following quadratic
equation in the unknown xm.

kxfn+2ymgxm—mv2=0

—u m g + [u2m2g2 + m k v2]1/2
m k

where we take the positive square root since
xm is positive. Putting in numerical values we

obtain

x = 1.35m

which, as expected, is less than the result in
Example 6.8.

If the two forces on the body consist of a
conservative force FC and a non-conservative
force FnC , the conservation of mechanical energy
formula will have to be modified. By the WE
theorem

(FC+ Fm) Ax = AK

But FC Ax = — AV
Hence, A(K + V) = FmAx
AE = FmAx

where E is the total mechanical energl. Over
the path this assumes the form

Ef— E, = Wnc

where WnC is the total work done by the
non-conservative forces over the path. Note that
