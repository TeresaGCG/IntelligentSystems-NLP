FIGURE 9.26 Sunlight travels through a longer distance in the
atmosphere at sunset and sunrise.

 

At sunset or sunrise, the sun’s rays have to pass through a larger
distance in the atmosphere (Fig. 9.26). Most of the blue and other shorter
wavelengths are removed by scattering. The least scattered light reaching
our eyes, therefore, the sun looks reddish. This explains the reddish
appearance of the sun and full moon near the horizon.

9.8 OPTICAL INSTRUMENTS

A number of optical devices and instruments have been designed utilising
reﬂecting and refracting properties of mirrors, lenses and prisms.
Periscope, kaleidoscope, binoculars, telescopes, microscopes are some
examples of optical devices and instruments that are in common use.
Our eye is, of course, one of the most important optical device the nature
has endowed us with. We have already studied about the human eye in
Class X. We now go on to describe the principles of working of the
microscope and the telescope.

9.8. 1 The microscope

A simple magniﬁer or microscope is a converging lens of small focal length
(Fig. 9.27). In order to use such a lens as a microscope, the lens is held
