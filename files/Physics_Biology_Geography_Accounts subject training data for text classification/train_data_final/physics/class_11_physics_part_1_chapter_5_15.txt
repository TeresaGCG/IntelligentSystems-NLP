5. 10 CIRCUIAR MOTION

We have seen in Chapter 4 that acceleration of
a body moving in a circle of radius R with uniform
speed I) is v2/ R directed towards the centre.
According to the second law, the force f providing
this acceleration is : C

where m is the mass of the body. This force
directed forwards the centre is called the
centripetal force. For a stone rotated in a circle
by a string, the centripetal force is provided by
the tension in the string. The centripetal force
for motion of a planet around the sun is the

is the static friction that provides the centripetal
acceleration. Static friction opposes the
impending motion of the car moving away from
the circle. Using equation (5.14) 8: (5.16) we get

which is independent of the mass of the car.
This shows that for a given value of us and R,
there is a maximum speed of circular motion of

gravitational force on the planet due to the sun.
For a car taking a circular turn on a horizontal
road, the centripetal force is the force of friction.

The circular motion of a car on a ﬂat and
banked road give interesting application of the
laws of motion.

Motion of a car on a level road
Three forces act on the car (Fig. 5.14(a):

(i) The weight of the car, mg
(ii) Normal reaction, N
(iii) Frictional force, f

As there is no acceleration in the vertical
direction

N — mg = O

N = mg (5.17)
The centripetal force required for circular motion
is along the surface of the road, and is provided
by the component of the contact force between
road and the car tyres along the surface. This
by definition is the frictional force. Note that it

Motion of a car on a banked road

We can reduce the contribution of friction to the
circular motion of the car if the road is banked
(Fig. 5. l4(b)). Since there is no acceleration along
the vertical direction, the net force along this
direction must be zero. Hence,

Ncos 0 = mg +fsin 6 (5.19a)
The centripetal force is provided by the horizontal
components of N and f.

Thus to obtain vmax we put

f=%N-

Then Eqs. (5. 19a) and (5. 19b) become
