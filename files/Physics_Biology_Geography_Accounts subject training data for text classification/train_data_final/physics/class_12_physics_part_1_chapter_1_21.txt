Thus, the heavier particle (proton) takes a greater time to fall through
the same distance. This is in basic contrast to the situation of ‘free
fall under gravity’ where the time of fall is independent of the mass of
the body. Note that in this example we have ignored the acceleration
due to gravity in calculating the time of fall. To see if this is justiﬁed,

let us calculate the acceleration of the proton in the given electric
field:

_(1.6 x 10“19 C) x (2.0 x 104 NC‘l)
_ 1.67 x 10—27 kg

 

= 1.9 x 1012 ms‘2

which is enormous compared to the value of g (9.8 m S”), the
acceleration due to gravity. The acceleration of the electron is even

greater. Thus, the effect of acceleration due to gravity can be ignored
in this example.

Example 1.9 Two point charges q1 and q2, of magnitude +10‘8 C and
—10‘8 C, respectively, are placed 0.1 m apart. Calculate the electric
fields at points A, B and C shown in Fig. 1.14.

 

FIGURE 1. 14

Solution The electric ﬁeld vector E1A at A due to the positive charge
q1 points towards the right and has a magnitude

9 2 —2 43
E1A=(9><10 NmC )2><(10 C) = 3.6x 104 NC’1
(0.05m)

The electric field vector E2A at A due to the negative charge q2 points

towards the right and has the same magnitude. Hence the magnitude
of the total electric field EA at A is

EA = E1A + E2A = 7.2 x 104 N C‘1
EA is directed toward the right.
