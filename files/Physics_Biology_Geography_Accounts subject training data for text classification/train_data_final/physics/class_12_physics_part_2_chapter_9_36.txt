What is the focal length of a convex lens of focal length 30cm in
contact with a concave lens of focal length 20cm? Is the system a
converging or a diverging lens? Ignore thickness of the lenses.

A compound microscope consists of an objective lens of focal length
2.0cm and an eyepiece of focal length 6.25cm separated by a
distance of 15cm. How far from the objective should an object be
placed in order to obtain the final image at (a) the least distance of
distinct vision (25cm), and (b) at infinity? What is the magnifying
power of the microscope in each case?

A person with a normal near point (25cm) using a compound
microscope with objective of focal length 8.0 mm and an eyepiece of
focal length 2.5cm can bring an object placed at 9.0mm from the
objective in sharp focus. What is the separation between the two
lenses? Calculate the magnifying power of the microscope,

A small telescope has an objective lens of focal length 144cm and
an eyepiece of focal length 6.0cm. What is the magnifying power of
the telescope? What is the separation between the objective and
the eyepiece?

(a) A giant refracting telescope at an observatory has an objective
lens of focal length 15m. If an eyepiece of focal length 1.0 cm is
used, what is the angular magnification of the telescope?

(b) If this telescope is used to view the moon, what is the diameter
of the image of the moon formed by the objective lens? The
diameter of the moon is 3.48 X 106m, and the radius of lunar
orbit is 3.8 x 108m.

Use the mirror equation to deduce that:

(a) an object placed between f and 2 f of a concave mirror produces
a real image beyond 2f.

(b) a convex mirror always produces a virtual image independent
of the location of the object.

(c) the virtual image produced by a convex mirror is always
diminished in size and is located between the focus and
the pole.

(d) an object placed between the pole and focus of a concave mirror
produces a virtual and enlarged image.

(Note: This exercise helps you deduce algebraically properties of

images that one obtains from explicit ray diagrams]

A small pin fixed on a table top is viewed from above from a distance
of 50cm. By what distance would the pin appear to be raised if it is
viewed from the same point through a 15cm thick glass slab held
parallel to the table? Refractive index of glass = 1.5. Does the answer
depend on the location of the slab?

(a) Figure 9.32 shows a cross-section of a ‘light pipe’ made of a
glass fibre of refractive index 1.68. The outer covering of the
pipe is made of a material of refractive index 1.44. What is the
range of the angles of the incident rays with the axis of the pipe
for which total reﬂections inside the pipe take place, as shown
in the figure.
