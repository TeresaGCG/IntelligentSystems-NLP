Alternating Current

 

Example 7.6 A resistor of 200 Q and a capacitor of 15.0 11F are
connected in series to a 220 V. 50 HZ ac source. (a) Calculate the
current in the circuit; (b) Calculate the voltage (rms) across the
resistor and the capacitor. Is the algebraic sum of these voltages
more than the source voltage? If yes. resolve the paradox.

Solution

Given
R = 2009. C = 15.0w 2 15.0 x 10’6F
V = 220v. v: 50Hz

(a) In order to calculate the current. we need the impedance of the
circuit. It is

Z 2 JR + X3 = R2 + (27er)’2

= (200(2)2 + (2 x 3.14 x 50 x 15.0 x 10’6F)’2

= (200 Q)2 + (212.3 52)2

= 291.67 9
Therefore. the current in the circuit is

Z 291.59

(b) Since the current is the same throughout the circuit. we have
VR 2 IR 2 (O.755A)(2OOQ) = 151V

VC 2 IXC = (0.755A)(212.3o) = 160.3V

The algebraic sum of the two voltages. VR and VC is 311.3 V which is
more than the source voltage of 220 V. How to resolve this paradox?
As you have learnt in the text. the two voltages are not in the same
phase. Therefore. they cannot be added like ordinary numbers. The
two voltages are out of phase by ninety degrees. Therefore. the total
of these voltages must be obtained using the Pythagorean theorem:

VR+C 2 VVIE) + W2
= 220 V

Thus. if the phase difference between two voltages is properly taken
into account. the total voltage across the resistor and the capacitor is
equal to the voltage of the source.
