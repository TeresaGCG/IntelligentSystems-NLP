13.30 Calculate and compare the energr released by a) fusion of 1.0 kg of

13.31

hydrogen deep within Sun and b) the ﬁssion of 1.0 kg of 235U in a
fission reactor.

Suppose India had a target of producing by 2020 AD, 200,000 MW
of electric power, ten percent of which was to be obtained from nuclear
power plants. Suppose we are given that, on an average, the efficiency
of utilization (i.e. conversion to electric energy) of thermal energy
produced in a reactor was 25%. How much amount of fissionable
uranium would our country need per year by 2020? Take the heat
energy per fission of 235U to be about 200MeV.
