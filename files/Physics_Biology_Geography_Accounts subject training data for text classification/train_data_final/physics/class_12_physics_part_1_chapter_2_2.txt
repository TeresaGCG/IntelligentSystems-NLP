Electrostatic Potential

(ii) Equation (2.2) deﬁnes potential energy difference in terms
of the physically meaningful quantity work. Clearly,
potential energy so deﬁned is undetermined to within an
additive constant.What this means is that the actual value
of potential energy is not physically signiﬁcant; it is only
the difference of potential energy that is signiﬁcant. We can
always add an arbitrary constant a to potential energy at
every point, since this will not change the potential energy
difference:

(UP+a)—(UR+a)=UP—UR

Put it differently, there is a freedom in choosing the point
where potential energy is zero. A convenient choice is to have
electrostatic potential energy zero at infinity. With this choice,
if we take the point R at inﬁnity, we get from Eq. (2.2)

WNP = UP — Um = UP (2.3)

Since the point P is arbitrary, Eq. (2.3) provides us with a
definition of potential energy of a charge q at any point.
Potential energy of charge q at a point (in the presence of ﬁeld
due to any charge conﬁguration) is the work done by the
external force (equal and opposite to the electric force) in
bringing the charge q from inﬁnity to that point.

2.2 ELECTROSTATIC POTENTIAL

Consider any general static charge configuration. We deﬁne
potential energy of a test charge q in terms of the work done
on the charge q. This work is obviously proportional to q, since
the force at any point is qE, where E is the electric field at that
point due to the given charge configuration. It is, therefore,
convenient to divide the work by the amount of charge q, so
that the resulting quantity is independent of q. In other words,
work done per unit test charge is characteristic of the electric
field associated with the charge conﬁguration. This leads to
the idea of electrostatic potential V due to a given charge
configuration. From Eq. (2.1), we get:

Work done by external force in bringing a unit positive
charge from point R to P

= VP— VR (2 —UP :11?)

Count Alessandro Volta
[1745 — 1827) Italian
physicist, professor at
Pavia. Volta established
that, the animal electri-
city observed by Luigi
Galvani, 1737—1798, in
experiments with frog
muscle tissue placed in
contact with dissimilar
metals, was not due to
any exceptional property
of animal tissues but
was also generated
whenever any wet body
was sandwiched between
dissimilar metals. This
led him to develop the
first voltaic pile, or
battery, consisting of a
large stack of moist disks
of cardboard (electro-
lyte) sandwiched
between disks of metal
(electrodes).

where Vpand VR are the electrostatic potentials at P and R, respectively.
Note, as before, that it is not the actual value of potential but the potential
difference that is physically signiﬁcant. If, as before, we choose the
potential to be zero at infinity, Eq. (2.4) implies:
Work done by an external force in bringing a unit positive charge
from inﬁnity to a point = electrostatic potential (V) at that point. 53
