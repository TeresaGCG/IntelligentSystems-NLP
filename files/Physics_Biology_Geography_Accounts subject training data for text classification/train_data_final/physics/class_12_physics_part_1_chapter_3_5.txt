time more than 1: and some less than ”C. In other words, the time ti in
Eq. (3.16) will be less than T for some and more than T for others as we go
through the values of i = 1, 2 ..... N. The average value of ti then is ’5
(known as relaxation time). Thus, averaging Eq. (3.16) over the
N—electrons at any given time t gives us for the average velocity vd

This last result is surprising. It tells us that the
electrons move with an average velocity which is
independent of time, although electrons are
accelerated. This is the phenomenon of drift and the
velocity vd in Eq. (3.1 7) is called the drift velocity.

Because of the drift, there will be net transport of
charges across any area perpendicular to E. Consider
a planar area A, located inside the conductor such that

Charge containffd in 3 Cylinder of unit Iv d | At would have crossed the area. If n is the number
area and length ”(r of free electrons per unit volume in the metal, then
there are 11 At | vd | A such electrons. Since each
electron carries a charge —e, the total charge transported across this area
A to the right in time At is —neA | vd | At. E is directed towards the left and
hence the total charge transported along E across the area is negative of
this. The amount of charge crossing the area A in time At is by definition

By definition I is related to the magnitude | j | of the current density by
