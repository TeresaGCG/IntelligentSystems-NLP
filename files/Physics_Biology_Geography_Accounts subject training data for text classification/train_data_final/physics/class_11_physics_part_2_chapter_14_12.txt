Example 14.8 A 5 kg collar is attached
to a spring of spring constant 500 N m'l. It
slides without friction over a horizontal rod.
The collar is displaced from its equilibrium

position by 10.0 cm and released. Calculate
(a) the period of oscillation.

(b) the maximum speed and

(c) maximum acceleration of the collar.

 

Answer (a) The period of oscillation as given by
Eq. (14.21) is,

f I 5.0kg
m _

= _ —27r

T 2” k 500Nm‘1

= (27r/ 10) s
= 0.63 s
(b) The velocity of the collar executing SHM is
given by,
v(t) = —Aco sin (cot + (1))
The maximum speed is given by,
vm = Aw

and it occurs at x = O
(c) The acceleration of the collar at the
displacement x (t) from the equilibrium is
given by,

14.8.2 The Simple Pendulum

It is said that Galileo measured the periods of a
swinging chandelier in a church by his pulse
beats. He observed that the motion of the
chandelier was periodic. The system is a kind

of pendulum. You can also make your own
pendulum by tying a piece of stone to a long
unstretchable thread, approximately 100 cm
long. Suspend your pendulum from a suitable
support so that it is free to oscillate. Displace
the stone to one side by a small distance and
let it go. The stone executes a to and fro motion,
it is periodic with a period of about two seconds.

We shall show that this periodic motion is
simple harmonic for small displacements from
the mean position. Consider simple pendulum
— a small bob of mass m tied to an inextensible
massless string of length L. The other end of
the string is fixed to a rigid support. The bob
oscillates in a plane about the vertical line
through the support. Fig. 14.18(a) shows this
system. Fig. 14.18(b) is a kind of ‘free-body’
diagram of the simple pendulum showing the
forces acting on the bob.

provides centripetal force but no torque
about the support. The tangential force
