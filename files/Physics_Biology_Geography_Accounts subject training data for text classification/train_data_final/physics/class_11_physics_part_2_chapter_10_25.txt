During blood transfusion the needle is inserted in a vein where the gauge pressure
is 2000 Pa. At what height must the blood container be placed so that blood may
just enter the vein ? [Use the density of whole blood from Table 10.1].

In deriving Bernoulli’s equation, we equated the work done on the ﬂuid in the tube
to its change in the potential and kinetic energy. [a] What is the largest average
velocity of blood ﬂow in an artery of diameter 2 x 10'3 m if the ﬂow must remain
laminar ? [b] Do the dissipative forces become more important as the ﬂuid velocity
increases ? Discuss qualitatively.

(a) What is the largest average velocity of blood ﬂow in an artery of radius 2X 10'3m
if the ﬂow must remain lanimar? (b) What is the corresponding ﬂow rate ? (Take
viscosity of blood to be 2.084 x 10'3 Pa s).

A plane is in level ﬂight at constant speed and each of its two wings has an area of
25 m2. If the speed of the air is 180 km/ h over the lower wing and 234 km/ h over
thee, upper wing surface, determine the plane’s mass. [Take air density to be 1 kg
m" ).

In Millikan’s oil dro experiment, what is the terminal speed of an uncharged drop
of radius 2.0 x 10' m and density 1.2 x 103 kg m'3. Take the viscosity of air at the
temperature of the experiment to be 1.8 x 10'5 Pa s. How much is the viscous force
on the drop at that speed ? Neglect buoyancy of the drop due to air.

Mercury has an angle of contact equal to 140° with soda lime glass. A narrow tube
of radius 1.00 mm made of this glass is dipped in a trough containing mercury. By
what amount does the mercury dip down in the tube relative to the liquid surface
outside ? Surface tension of mercury at the temperature of the experiment is 0.465
N m'l. Density of mercury = 13.6 x 103 kg m'3.

Two narrow bores of diameters 3.0 mm and 6.0 mm are joined together to form
a U-tube open at both ends. If the U—tube contains water, what is the difference in
its levels in the two limbs of the tube ? Surface tension of water at the temperature
of the experiment is 7.3 X 10'2 N m'l. Take the angle of contact to be zero and
density ofwater to be 1.0 x 103 kg m"3 [g = 9.8 m s'2] .

(a) It is known that density p of air decreases with height y as
P = pOe-y/yo

where p0 = 1.25 kg rrr3 is the density at sea level, and yo is a constant. This density

variation is called the law of atmospheres. Obtain this law assuming that the

temperature of atmosphere remains a constant [isothermal conditions). Also assume

that the value of 9 remains constant.

(b) A large He balloon of volume 1425 m3 is used to lift a payload of 400 kg. Assume

that the balloon maintains constant radius as it rises. How high does it rise ?
[Take yo = 8000 m and pHe = 0.18 kg m’3].
