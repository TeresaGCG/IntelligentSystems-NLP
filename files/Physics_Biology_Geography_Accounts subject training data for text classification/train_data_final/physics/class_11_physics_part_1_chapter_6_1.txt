A dot B) is defined as
A-B =ABcos 0 (6.1a)

where 0 is the angle between the two vectors as
shown in Fig. 6.1(a). Since A, B and cos 0 are
scalars, the dot product of A and B is a scalar
quantity. Each vector, A and B, has a direction
but their scalar product does not have a
direction.

From Eq. (6. la), we have

A-B =A (B cos 0)
= B (A cos 0)

Geometrically, B cos 0 is the projection of B onto
A in Fig.6. 1 (b) and A cos 6 is the projection of A
onto B in Fig. 6.1 (c). So, AB is the product of
the magnitude of A and the component of B along
A. Alternatively, it is the product of the
magnitude of B and the component of A along B.

Equation (6. la) shows that the scalar product
follows the commutative law :

A-B = B-A

Scalar product obeys the distributive
law:

A- (B + C) = A-B +A-C
Further, A- (7L B) = 7L (A-B)
where 7L is a real number.

The proofs of the above equations are left to
you as an exercise.

A = Axi + ij + All}

their scalar product is
AB = (Axi + ij + Azli)-(Bxi + By} + 3211)
= AXBX + AyBy + AZBZ (6.1b)

From the definition of scalar product and
(Eq. 6. lb) we have :

(1) A.A = AXAX + AyAy + AZAZ
2 2 2 2
Or, A = AX + Ag + AZ (6. 1c)

since A-A= IA | |A| cos 0 =A2.
(ii) AB = 0, if A and B are perpendicular.

P Example 6.1 Find the angle between force
F = (3 i + 4 j - 5 1;] unit and displacement

d = [5i+4j+3f{) unit. Also find the
projection ofF on d.
AnswerF-d = dex + Fydy + dez

=3(5)+4(4)+(—5)(3)
16 unit

 

Hence F-d = Fd cos6? = 16 unit

NowF-F = F2 =Fx2 +Fy2 +Fz2
