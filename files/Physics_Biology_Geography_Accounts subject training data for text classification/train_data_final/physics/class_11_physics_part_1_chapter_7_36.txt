15. Rotation about a fixed axis is directly analogous to linear motion in respect of kinematics
and dynamics.

16. For a rigid body rotating about a fixed axis (say, z—axis) of rotation, LZ = [(0, where I is
the moment of inertia about z—axis. In general, the angular momentum L for such a
body is not along the axis of rotation. Only if the body is symmetric about the axis of

rotation, L is along the axis of rotation. In that case, |L| = LZ = I a). The angular

acceleration of a rigid body rotating about a fixed axis is given by Ia = r. If the external
torque ”C acting on the body is zero, the component of angular momentum about the
fixed axis (say, z—axis), LZ (=Ico) of such a rotating body is constant.

1 7. For rolling motion without slipping vcm = Ra), where vcm is the velocity of translation (i.e.
of the centre of mass), R is the radius and mis the mass of the body. The kinetic energy
of such a rolling body is the sum of kinetic energies of translation and rotation:

1. To determine the motion of the centre of mass of a system no knowledge of internal
forces of the system is required. For this purpose we need to know only the external
forces on the body.

Separating the motion of a system of particles as the motion of the centre of mass. (i.e..
the translational motion of the system) and motion about (i.e. relative to) the centre of
mass of the system is a useful technique in dynamics of a system of particles. One
example of this technique is separating the kinetic energy of a system of particles K as
the kinetic energy of the system about its centre of mass K’ and the kinetic energl of
the centre of mass MVZ/2.

K = K’ + MW/ 2
Newton’s Second Law for finite sized bodies (or systems of particles) is based in N ewton‘s
Second Law and also Newton's Third Law for particles.
To establish that the time rate of change of the total angular momentum of a system of
particles is the total external torque in the system, we need not only Newton‘s second
law for particles. but also N ewton's third law with the provision that the forces between
any two particles act along the line joining the particles.
The vanishing of the total external force and the vanishing of the total external torque
are independent conditions. We can have one without the other. In a couple. total
external force is zero, but total torque is non—zero.
The total torque on a system is independent of the origin if the total external force is
zero.
The centre of gravity of a body coincides with its centre of mass only if the gravitational
field does not vary from one part of the body to the other.
The angular momentum L and the angular velocity 0) are not necessarily parallel vectors.
However. for the simpler situations discussed in this chapter when rotation is about a
fixed axis which is an axis of symmetry of the rigid body. the relation L = 10) holds good.
where I is the moment of the inertia of the body about the rotation axis.
