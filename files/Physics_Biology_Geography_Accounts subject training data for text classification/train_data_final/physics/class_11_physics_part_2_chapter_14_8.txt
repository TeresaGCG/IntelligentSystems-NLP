the value of x between —A and A, the acceleration
a(t) is always directed towards the centre.

For simplicity, let us put (1) = 0 and write the
expression for x (t), v (t) and a(t)

)dt) = A cos cot, v(t) = — wAsin out, a(t)=—a)2 A cos cut
The corresponding plots are shown in Fig. 14.1 3.
All quantities vary sinusoidally with time; only
their maxima differ and the different plots differ
in phase. x varies between —A to A; v(t) varies
from —a)A to (0A and a(t) from —a)2A to (02A. With
respect to displacement plot, velocity plot has a
phase difference of 7r/ 2 and acceleration plot
has a phase difference of 7c.

a particle in simple harmonic motion have
the same period T, but they differ in phase

Example 1 4.5 A body oscillates with SHM
according to the equation (in SI units),

x= 5 cos I27: t+ 75/4].

At t= 1.5 s. calculate the (a) displacement.
(b) speed and (c) acceleration of the body.

 

Answer The angular frequency a) of the body
= 27: S‘1 and its time period T= 1 s.

At t= 1.5 S
(a) displacement = (5.0 m) cos [(27r S'l) X
1.5 s + 7r/4]
= (5.0 m) cos [(37r+ 3/4)]
= —5.0 X 0.707 m
= —3.535 m

(b) Using Eq. (14.9), the speed of the body
= — (5.0 m)(21t S'l) sin [(27r S'l) X1.5 s
+ 7r/4]
= — (5.0 m)(27rs") sin [(371'+ 7r/4)]
= 107r>< 0.707 m s-1
= 22 m s-1

(c) Using Eq.(14. 10), the acceleration of the
body
= —(27r S'1)2 X displacement
= — (27: s‘l)2 X (—3.535 m)

= 140 m S‘2 ‘
14.6 FORCE LAW FOR SIMPLE HARMONIC
MOTION

Using Newton’s second law of motion, and the
expression for acceleration of a particle
undergoing SHM (Eq. 14.1 1), the force acting
on a particle of mass m in SHM is

F(t) = ma
= —man (t)
i.e., F(t) =—kx(t) (14.13)
where k = ma)2 (14.14a)
or a) = E (14.14b)
m

Like acceleration, force is always directed
towards the mean position—hence it is sometimes
called the restoring force in SHM. To summarise
the discussion so far, simple harmonic motion can
be defined in two equivalent ways, either by Eq.
(14.4) for displacement or by Eq. (14. 13) that gives
its force law. Going from Eq. (14.4) to Eq. (14.13)
required us to differentiate two times. Likewise,
by integrating the force law Eq. (14.13) two times,
we can get back Eq. (14.4).

Note that the force in Eq. (14.13) is linearly
proportional to At). A particle oscillating under
such a force is, therefore, calling a linear
harmonic oscillator. In the real world, the force
may contain small additional terms proportional
to x2, )8, etc. These then are called non-linear
oscillators.

Example 14.6 Two identical springs of
spring constant k are attached to a block
of mass m and to fixed supports as shown
in Fig. 14.14. Show that when the mass is

displaced from its equilibrium position on
either side. it executes a simple harmonic
motion. Find the period of oscillations.
