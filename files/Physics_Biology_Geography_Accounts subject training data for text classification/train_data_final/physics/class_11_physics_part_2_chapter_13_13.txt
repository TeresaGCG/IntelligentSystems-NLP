Seeing is Believing

Can one see atoms rushing about. Almost but not quite. One can see pollen grains of a ﬂower being
pushed around by molecules of water. The size of the grain is ~ 10’5 m. In 1827, a Scottish botanist
Robert Brown. while examining. under a microscope. pollen grains of a ﬂower suspended in water
noticed that they continuously moved about in a zigzag. random fashion.

Kinetic theory provides a simple explanation of the phenomenon. Any object suspended in water is
continuously bombarded from all sides by the water molecules. Since the motion of molecules is random,
the number of molecules hitting the object in any direction is about the same as the number hitting in
the opposite direction. The small difference between these molecular hits is negligible compared to the
total number of hits for an object of ordinary size. and we do not notice any movement of the object.

When the object is sufficiently small but still visible under a microscope, the difference in molecular
hits from different directions is not altogether negligible. i.e. the impulses and the torques given to the
suspended object through continuous bombardment by the molecules of the medium [water or some
other ﬂuid) do not exactly sum to zero. There is a net impulse and torque in this or that direction. The
suspended object thus, moves about in a zigzag manner and tumbles about randomly. This motion
called now ‘Brownian motion” is a visible proof of molecular activity. In the last 50 years or so molecules
have been seen by scanning tunneling and other special microscopes.

[n 1987 Ahmed Zewail. an Egyptian scientist working in USA was able to observe not only the
molecules but also their detailed interactions. He did this by illuminating them with ﬂashes of laser
light for very short durations, of the order of tens of femtoseconds and photographing them. ( l femto-
second = 10'15 s ). One could study even the formation and breaking of chemical bonds. That. is really
seeing !
