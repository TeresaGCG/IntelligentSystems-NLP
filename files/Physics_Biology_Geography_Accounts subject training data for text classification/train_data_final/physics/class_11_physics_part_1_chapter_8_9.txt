If we associate a potential energy W(h) at a
point at a height h above the surface such that

W(h) = mgh + W0 (8.21)
(where WO = constant) ;
then it is clear that

W12 = W(h) — W(hl) (8.22)

The work done in moving the particle is just
the difference of potential energy between its
final and initial positions.Observe that the
constant W0 cancels out in Eq. (8.22). Setting
h = O in the last equation, we get W( h = O ) =
W0. . h = 0 means points on the surface of the
earth. Thus, W0 is the potential energy on the
surface of the earth.

If we consider points at arbitrary distance
from the surface of the earth, the result just
derived is not valid since the assumption that
the gravitational force mg is a constant is no
longer valid. However, from our discussion we
know that a point outside the earth, the force of
gravitation on a particle directed towards the
centre of the earth is

GM E m

F= r2 (8.23)

where ME = mass of earth, m = mass of the
particle and r its distance from the centre of the
earth. If we now calculate the work done in
lifting a particle from r= r1 to r = r2 (r2 > r1) along
a vertical path, we get instead of Eq. (8.20)

In place of Eq. (8.2 1), we can thus associate

a potential energy W(r) at a distance r, such that

valid for r > R ,

so that once again W12 = W(r2) — W(rl).
Setting r = infinity in the last equation, we get
W ( r = infinity ) = W1. Thus, W1 is the
potential energy at infinity. One should note that
only the difference of potential energy between
two points has a definite meaning from Eqs.
(8.22) and (8.24). One conventionally sets W1
equal to zero, so that the potential energy at a
point is just the amount of work done in

displacing the particle from infinity to that point.

We have calculated the potential energy at
a point of a particle due to gravitational forces
on it due to the earth and it is proportional to
the mass of the particle. The gravitational
potential due to the gravitational force of the
earth is defined as the potential energy of a
particle of unit mass at that point. From the
earlier discussion, we learn that the gravitational
potential energy associated with two particles
of masses m1 and m2 separated by distance by a
distance r is given by

It should be noted that an isolated system
of particles will have the total potential energy
that equals the sum of energies (given by the
above equation) for all possible pairs of its

constituent particles. This is an example of the
application of the superposition principle.
