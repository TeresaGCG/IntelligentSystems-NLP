Solution
Method I
As the rod is rotated, free electrons in the rod move towards the outer
end due to Lorentz force and get distributed over the ring. Thus, the
resulting separation of charges produces an emf across the ends of
the rod. At a certain value of emf, there is no more ﬂow of electrons
and a steady state is reached. Using Eq. (6.5), the magnitude of the
emf generated across a length dr of the rod as it moves at right angles
to the magnetic field is given by
d8 = Bvdr. Hence,

Note that we have used v = a) r. This gives
8 =§xl.0x2nx50x(l2)
= 157 V
Method H
To calculate the emf, we can imagine a closed loop OPQ in which
point 0 and P are connected with a resistor R and 09 is the rotating
rod. The potential difference across the resistor is then equal to the
induced emf and equals B X (rate of change of area of loop). If 0 is the
angle between the rod and the radius of the circle at P at time t, the
area of the sector OPQ is given by
1: R2 x i = 1 R29
21: 2
where R is the radius of the circle. Hence, the induced emf is
