EXERCISES

A string of mass 2.50 kg is under a tension of 200 N. The length of the stretched
string is 20.0 m. If the transverse jerk is struck at one end of the string, how long
does the disturbance take to reach the other end?

A stone dropped from the top of a tower of height 300 m splashes into the water of
a pond near the base of the tower. When is the splash heard at the top given that
the speed of sound in air is 340 m s*1 ? [g = 9.8 m s”)

A steel wire has a length of 12.0 m and a mass of 2.10 kg. What should be the
tension in the wire so that speed of a transverse wave on the wire equals the speed
of sound in dry air at 20°C = 343 m s‘l.

I P
Use the formula v = Y— to explain why the speed of sound in air
,0

(a) is independent of pressure,
(b) increases with temperature,

(c) increases with humidity.

You have learnt that a travelling wave in one dimension is represented by a function
y = f (x, t) where x and t must appear in the combination x — v t or x + v t, i.e.
y = f (x i v t). Is the converse true? Examine if the following functions for y can
possibly represent a travelling wave :

(a) (x — vt )2
(b) log [[x + vt]/x0]
(C) 1 / (x + vt}

A bat emits ultrasonic sound of frequency 1000 kHz in air. If the sound meets a
water surface, what is the wavelength of (a) the reﬂected sound, [b] the transmitted
sound? Speed of sound in air is 340 m s ‘1 and in water 1486 m s4.

A hospital uses an ultrasonic scanner to locate tumours in a tissue. What is the
wavelength of sound in the tissue in which the speed of sound is 1.7 km s*1 ? The
operating frequency of the scanner is 4.2 MHz.

A transverse harmonic wave on a string is described by
y(x, t) = 3.0 sin [36 t + 0.018 x+ 7r/4]
where x and y are in cm and tin s. The positive direction of xis from left to right.
(a) Is this a travelling wave or a stationary wave ?
If it is travelling, what are the speed and direction of its propagation ?
(b) What are its amplitude and frequency ?

(c) What is the initial phase at the origin ?

(d) What is the least distance between two successive crests in the wave ?

For the wave described in Exercise 15. 8, plot the displacement (y) versus [t] graphs
for x = 0, 2 and 4 cm. What are the shapes of these graphs? In which aspects does
the oscillatory motion in travelling wave differ from one point to another: amplitude,
frequency or phase ?

For the travelling harmonic wave
y[x, t] = 2.0 cos 27L" [10t— 0.0080 x + 0.35)
