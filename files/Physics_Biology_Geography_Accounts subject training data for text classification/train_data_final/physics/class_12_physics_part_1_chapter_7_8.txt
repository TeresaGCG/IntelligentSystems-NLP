(d) Predict the polarity of the capacitor in the situation described by

Solution

(a) No. However strong the magnet may be, current can be induced
only by changing the magnetic ﬂux through the loop.

(b) No current is induced in either case. Current can not be induced
by changing the electric ﬂux.

(c) The induced emf is expected to be constant only in the case of the
rectangular loop. In the case of circular loop, the rate of change of
area of the loop during its passage out of the ﬁeld region is not
constant, hence induced emf will vary accordingly.

((1) The polarity of plate ‘A’ will be positive with respect to plate ‘B’ in
the capacitor.

6.6 MOTIONAL ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE

Let us consider a straight conductor moving in a uniform and time-
independent magnetic ﬁeld. Figure 6.10 shows a rectangular conductor
PQRS in which the conductor P9 is free to move. The rod P9 is moved

towards the left with a constant velocity v as

 

 

 

 

 

>< shown in the figure. Assume that there is no
loss of energy due to friction. PQRS forms a
X closed circuit enclosing an area that changes
X as PQ moves. It is placed in a uniform magnetic
ﬁeld B which is perpendicular to the plane of
X this system. If the length R9 = xand RS = l, the
magnetic ﬂux (DB enclosed by the loop PQRS
X will be
X ch = le
Since xis changing with time, the rate of change
of ﬂux (DB will induce an emf given by:
