6.26 A 1 kg block situated on a rough incline is connected to a spring of spring constant 100
N m‘1 as shown in Fig. 6.17. The block is released from rest with the spring in the
unstretched position. The block moves 10 cm down the incline before coming to rest.
Find the coefficient of friction between the block and the incline. Assume that the
spring has a negligible mass and the pulley is frictionless.

= 100 N/m

6.27 A bolt of mass 0.3 kg falls from the ceiling of an elevator moving down with an uniform
speed of 7 m s‘l. It hits the ﬂoor of the elevator [length of the elevator = 3 m) and does
not rebound. What is the heat produced by the impact ? Would your answer be different
if the elevator were stationary ?

6.28 A trolley of mass 200 kg moves with a uniform speed of 36 km/ h on a frictionless track.
A child of mass 20 kg runs on the trolley from one end to the other [10 m away) with a
speed of 4 m 5'1 relative to the trolley in a direction opposite to the its motion, and
jumps out of the trolley. What is the final speed of the trolley ? How much has the
trolley moved from the time the child begins to run ?

6.29 Which of the following potential energy curves in Fig. 6.18 cannot possibly describe the
elastic collision of two billiard balls ? Here r is the distance between centres of the balls.
