Figure 3.21 shows the x—t plot of one—dimensional
motion of a particle. Is it correct to say from the
graph that the particle moves in a straight line for
t < 0 and on a parabolic path for t>0 ? If not, suggest
a suitable physical context for this graph.

A police van moving on a highway with a speed of
30 km h“ fires a bullet at a thief s car speeding away
in the same direction with a speed of 192 km h’l. If
the muzzle speed of the bullet is 150 m S4, with
what speed does the bullet hit the thiefs car ? (Note:
Obtain that speed which is relevant for damaging
the thiefs car].

Suggest a suitable physical situation for each of the
following graphs [Fig 3.22]:

Figure 3.23 gives the x—t plot of a particle executing one—dimensional simple
harmonic motion. [You will learn about this motion in more detail in Chapterl4).
Give the signs of position, velocity and acceleration variables of the particle at
t= 0.3 s, 1.2 s. — 1.2 s.

Figure 3.24 gives the x—t plot of a
particle in one—dimensional motion.
Three different equal intervals of time
are shown. In which interval is the
average speed greatest, and in which
is it the least ? Give the sign of average
velocity for each interval.
