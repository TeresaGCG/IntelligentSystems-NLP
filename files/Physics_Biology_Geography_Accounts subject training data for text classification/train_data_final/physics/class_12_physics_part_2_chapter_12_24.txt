humans can perceive (~10’10 W m’2). Take the area of the pupil
to be about 0.4 cm2, and the average frequency of white light to
be about 6 X 1014 Hz.

Ultraviolet light of wavelength 2271 A from a 100 W mercury source
irradiates a photo-cell made of molybdenum metal. If the stopping
potential is —1.3 V, estimate the work function of the metal. How
would the photo-cell respond to a high intensity (~105 W m’z) red
light of wavelength 6328 A produced by a He-Ne laser?

Monochromatic radiation of wavelength 640.2 nm (1nm = 10’9 m)
from a neon lamp irradiates photosensitive material made of caesium
on tungsten. The stopping voltage is measured to be 0.54 V. The
source is replaced by an iron source and its 427.2 nm line irradiates
the same photo-cell. Predict the new stopping voltage.

A mercury lamp is a convenient source for studying frequency
dependence of photoelectric emission, since it gives a number of
spectral lines ranging from the UV to the red end of the visible
spectrum. In our experiment with rubidium photo-cell, the following

lines from a mercury source were used:

A, = 3650 A, AZ: 4047 A, A3: 4358 A, 7.4: 5461 A, As: 6907 A,
The stopping voltages, respectively, were measured to be:
V01 = 1.28 V, V02 = 0.95 V, V03 = 0.74 V, V04 = 0.16 V, V05 = 0 V

Determine the value of Planck’s constant 11, the threshold frequency
and work function for the material.

[Note: You will notice that to get h from the data, you will need to
know 6 (which you can take to be 1.6 X 10’19 C). Experiments of this
kind on Na, Li, K, etc, were performed by Millikan, who, using his
own value of e (from the oil-drop experiment) confirmed Einstein’s
photoelectric equation and at the same time gave an independent
estimate of the value of h.]

The work function for the following metals is given:

Na: 2.75 eV; K: 2.30 eV; Mo: 4.17 eV; Ni: 5.15 eV. Which of these
metals will not give photoelectric emission for a radiation of
wavelength 3300 A from a He-Cd laser placed 1 m away from the
photocell? What happens if the laser is brought nearer and placed
50 cm away?

Light of intensity 10’5 W m’2 falls on a sodium photo-cell of surface
area 2 cm2. Assuming that the top 5 layers of sodium absorb the
incident energy, estimate time required for photoelectric emission
in the wave-picture of radiation, The work function for the metal is
given to be about 2 eV. What is the implication of your answer?

Crystal diffraction experiments can be performed using X-rays, or
electrons accelerated through appropriate voltage. Which probe has
greater energy? (For quantitative comparison, take the wavelength
of the probe equal to 1 A, which is of the order of inter-atomic spacing

in the lattice) (me=9.11 X 10’31 kg).
(a) Obtain the de Broglie wavelength of a neutron of kinetic energy
150 eV. As you have seen in Exercise 1 1.31, an electron beam of

this energy is suitable for crystal diffraction experiments. Would
a neutron beam of the same energy be equally suitable? Explain.
