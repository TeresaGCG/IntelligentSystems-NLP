EXAMPLE 12.6

 

the same energy needed by the electron in a lower energy state to make
transitions to a higher energy state, the process is called absorption.
Thus if photons with a continuous range of frequencies pass through a
rarefied gas and then are analysed with a spectrometer, a series of dark
spectral absorption lines appear in the continuous spectrum. The dark
lines indicate the frequencies that have been absorbed by the atoms of
the gas.

The explanation of the hydrogen atom spectrum provided by Bohr’s
model was a brilliant achievement, which greatly stimulated progress
towards the modern quantum theory. In 1922, Bohr was awarded Nobel
Prize in Physics.

Example 12.6 Using the Rydberg formula, calculate the wavelengths
of the first four spectral lines in the Lyman series of the hydrogen
spectrum.

Solution The Rydberg formula is

The wavelengths of the first four lines in the Lyman series correspond
to transitions from nl. = 2,3,4,5 to n = 1. We know that

12.6 DE BROGLIE’S EXPLANATION OF BOHR’S

SECOND POSTULATE 0F QUANTISATION

Of all the postulates, Bohr made in his model of the atom, perhaps the
most puzzling is his second postulate. It states that the angular
momentum of the electron orbiting around the nucleus is quantised (that
is, Ln = nh/27t; n = 1, 2, 3 ...). Why should the angular momentum have
only those values that are integral multiples of h/ 27:? The French physicist
Louis de Broglie explained this puzzle in 1923, ten years after Bohr
proposed his model.

We studied, in Chapter 11, about the de Broglie’s hypothesis that
material particles, such as electrons, also have awave nature. C. J. Davisson
and L. H. Germer later experimentally veriﬁed the wave nature of electrons
