i Physics

Now, let us recollect Experiment 6.3 in Section 6.2. In that experiment,
emf is induced in coil C1 wherever there was any change in current through
coil C2. Let ‘1’1 be the ﬂux through coil C1 (say of N1 turns) when current in
coil 02 is 12.

Then, from Eq. (6.9), we have

It shows that varying current in a coil can induce emf in a neighbouring
coil. The magnitude of the induced emf depends upon the rate of change
of current and mutual inductance of the two coils.

6.9.2 Self-inductance

In the previous sub-section, we considered the ﬂux in one solenoid due
to the current in the other. It is also possible that emf is induced in a
single isolated coil due to change of ﬂux through the coil by means of
varying the current through the same coil. This phenomenon is called
self-induction. In this case, ﬂux linkage through a coil of N turns is
proportional to the current through the coil and is expressed as

N%«I

Ng=L1 $13

where constant of proportionality Lis called self-inductance of the coil. It
is also called the coeﬁicient of self-induction of the coil. When the current
is varied, the ﬂux linked with the coil also changes and an emf is induced
in the coil. Using Eq. (6.15), the induced emf is given by

Thus, the self-induced emf always opposes any change (increase or
decrease) of current in the coil.

It is possible to calculate the self-inductance for circuits with simple
geometries. Let us calculate the self-inductance of a long solenoid of cross-
sectional area A and length I, having nturns per unit length. The magnetic
field due to a current I ﬂowing in the solenoid is B = #0 n I (neglecting edge
effects, as before). The total ﬂux linked with the solenoid is
