EXAMPLE 7. 1

 

 

Example 7.1 A light bulb is rated at 100W for a 220 V supply. Find
(a) the resistance of the bulb: (b) the peak voltage of the source: and
(c) the rms current through the bulb.

Solution

(a) We are given P = 100 W and V = 220 V. The resistance of the
bulb is

220v2
V—=(— ) 24849
P 100w

(b) The peak voltage of the source is
um = JEV = 311v
(c) Since. P = I V

P _ 100w

V 220V
