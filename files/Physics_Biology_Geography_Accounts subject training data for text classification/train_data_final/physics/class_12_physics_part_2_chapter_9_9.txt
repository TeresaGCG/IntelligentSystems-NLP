deviation, but it does suffer lateral displacement/

Obsewer shift with respect to the incident ray. Another familiar

Q observation is that the bottom of a tank ﬁlled with

water appears to be raised (Fig. 9.10). For viewing

The refraction of light through the atmosphere
is responsible for many interesting phenomena. For
example, the Sun is visible a little before the actual
sunrise and until a little after the actual sunset
due to refraction of light through the atmosphere
(Fig. 9.1 1). By actual sunrise we mean the actual
crossing of the horizon by the sun. Figure 9.1 1
shows the actual and apparent positions of the Sun
with respect to the horizon. The ﬁgure is highly
exaggerated to show the effect. The refractive index
of air with respect to vacuum is 1.00029. Due to
this, the apparent shift in the direction of the Sun

apparent ﬂattening (oval shape) of the Sun at sunset
and sunrise is also due to the same phenomenon.

Example 9.5 The earth takes 24 h to rotate once about its axis. How
much time does the sun take to shift by 1° when viewed from
the earth?

Solution
Time taken for 360° shift = 24 h

Time taken for 1° shift = 24/360 h = 4 min.
