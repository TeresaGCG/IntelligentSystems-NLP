is characteristic of the present state of conﬁguration, and not the way
the state is achieved.

Example 2.4 Four charges are arranged at the corners of a square
ABCD of side d, as shown in Fig. 2.15.(a) Find the work required to
put together this arrangement. (b) A charge qO is brought to the centre
E of the square, the four charges being held fixed at its corners. How
much extra work is needed to do this?

Solution

(a) Since the work done depends on the final arrangement of the

charges, and not on how they are put together, we calculate work

needed for one way of putting the charges at A, B, C and D. Suppose,

first the charge +q is brought to A, and then the charges —q, +q, and

—q are brought to B, C and D, respectively. The total work needed can

be calculated in steps:

(i) Work needed to bring charge +q to A when no charge is present
elsewhere: this is zero.

(ii) Work needed to bring —q to B when +q is at A. This is given by
(charge at B) X (electrostatic potential at B due to charge +q at A)

(iii) Work needed to bring charge +q to C when +q is at A and —q is at
B. This is given by (charge at C) X (potential at C due to charges
at A and B)

 

 

 

 

(iv) Work needed to bring —q to D when +q at A,—q at B, and +q at C.
This is given by (charge at D) X (potential at D due to charges at A,
B and C)
