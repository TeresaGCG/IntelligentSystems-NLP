Equation (2.8) is true for any
sign of the charge Q, though we
considered Q > O in its derivation.
For Q < O, V< O, i.e., work done (by
the external force) per unit positive
test charge in bringing it from
inﬁnity to the point is negative. This
is equivalent to saying that work
done by the electrostatic force in
bringing the unit positive charge
form infinity to the point P is
positive. [This is as it should be,
since for Q < O, the force on a unit
positive test charge is attractive, so
that the electrostatic force and the
displacement (from inﬁnity to P) are
in the same direction.] Finally, we
note that Eq. (2.8) is consistent with
the choice that potential at infinity
be zero.

Figure (2.4) shows how the electrostatic potential (0: 1 / r) and the
electrostatic field (o< l / r2 ) varies with r.

Example 2. 1

(a) Calculate the potential at a point P due to a charge of 4 X 10‘7C

located 9 cm away.

(b) Hence obtain the work done in bringing a charge of 2 X 10-9 C
from infinity to the point P. Does the answer depend on the path
along which the charge is brought?

No, work done will be path independent. Any arbitrary infinitesimal
path can be resolved into two perpendicular displacements: One along
1‘ and another perpendicular to r. The work done corresponding to

the later will be zero.

2.4 POTENTIAL DUE To AN ELECTRIC DIPOLE

As we learnt in the last chapter, an electric dipole consists of two charges
q and —q separated by a (small) distance 2a. Its total charge is zero. It is
characterised by a dipole moment vector p whose magnitude is q X 2a
and which points in the direction from —q to q (Fig. 2.5). We also saw that
the electric field of a dipole at a point with position vector r depends not

just on the magnitude r, but also on the angle between 1' and p. Further,
