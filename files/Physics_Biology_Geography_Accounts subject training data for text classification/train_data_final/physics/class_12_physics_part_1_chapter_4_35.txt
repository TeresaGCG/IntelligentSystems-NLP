To obtain the total field at P, we must integrate this vector expression
over the entire length of the conductor.

The magnitude of the magnetic field due to a circular coil of radius R
carrying a current I at an axial distance x from the centre is

__ #0 1R2
_ 2(x2 + R2)3/2

At the centre this reduces to

B=#_ol
2R

Ampere’s Circuital Law: Let an open surface S be bounded by a loop
C. Then the Ampere’s law states that § B,dl = #01 Where I refers to
c

the current passing through S. The sign of I is determined from the
right—hand rule. We have discussed a simplified form of this law. If B
is directed along the tangent to every point on the perimeter L of a
closed curve and is constant in magnitude along perimeter then,

BL = #0 Ie

where Ie is the net current enclosed by the closed circuit.

The magnitude of the magnetic field at a distance R from a long,
straight wire carrying a current I is given by:

B: #01
271R

 

The field lines are circles concentric with the wire.

The magnitude of the field B inside a long solenoid carrying a current
I is

B = ,uonI

where n is the number of turns per unit length. For a toroid one
obtains,

B= ”OM
21w

 

where N is the total number of turns and r is the average radius.
Parallel currents attract and anti—parallel currents repel.

A planar loop carrying a current I, having N closely wound turns, and
an area A possesses a magnetic moment m where,

m = N I A
and the direction of m is given by the right-hand thumb rule : curl
the palm of your right hand along the loop with the fingers pointing

in the direction of the current. The thumb sticking out gives the
direction of m (and A]

When this loop is placed in a uniform magnetic field B, the force F on
it is: F = 0

And the torque on it is,

4: = m X B

In a moving coil galvanometer, this torque is balanced by a counter—
torque due to a spring, yielding

kq) = NI AB
