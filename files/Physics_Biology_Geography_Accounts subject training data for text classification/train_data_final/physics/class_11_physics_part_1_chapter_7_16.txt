The force Fi on the {tharticle is the vector

sum of external forces Ff“ acting on the particle

and the internal forces F1.int exerted on it by the

other particles of the system. We may therefore
separate the contribution of the external and
the internal forces to the total torque

We shall assume not only Newton’s third law
of motion, i.e. the forces between any two particles
of the system are equal and opposite, but also that
these forces are directed along the line joining the
two particles. In this case the contribution of the
internal forces to the total torque on the system is
zero, since the torque resulting from each action-
reaction pair of forces is zero. We thus have, 1m =
0 and therefore 1: = 1m.

Since 1: = 21:, , it follows from Eq. (7 .28a)
that

Thus, the time rate of the total angular
momentum of a system of particles about a
point (taken as the origin of our frame of
reference) is equal to the sum of the external
torques (i.e. the torques due to external forces)
acting on the system taken about the same
point. Eq. (7.28 b) is the generalisation of the
single particle case of Eq. (7.23) to a system of
particles. Note that when we have only one
particle, there are no internal forces or torques.
Eq.(7 .28 b) is the rotational analogue of

(7.28 b)

Note that like Eq.(7 .17), Eq.(7.28b) holds
good for any system of particles, whether it is a
rigid body or its individual particles have all
kinds of internal motion.

Conservation of angular momentum

If text: 0, Eq. (7 .28b) reduces to

d_L = 0
dt
or L = constant. (7 .29a)

Thus, if the total external torque on a system
of particles is zero, then the total angular
momentum of the system is conserved, i.e.
remains constant. Eq. (7 .29a) is equivalent to
three scalar equations,

LX=K1, Ly =K2 and LZ=K3 (7.29 b)

Here K1, K2 and K3 are constants; LX, Ly and
L2 are the components of the total angular
momentum vector L along the x,y and z axes
respectively. The statement that the total
angular momentum is conserved means that
each of these three components is conserved.

Eq. (7.29a) is the rotational analogue of
Eq. (7 . 18a), i.e. the conservation law of the total
linear momentum for a system of particles.
Like Eq. (7 .18a), it has applications in many
practical situations. We shall look at a few of
the interesting applications later on in this
chapter.
