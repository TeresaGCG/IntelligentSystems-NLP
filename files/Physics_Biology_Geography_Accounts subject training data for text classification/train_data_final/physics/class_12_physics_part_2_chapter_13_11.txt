Example 13.5 Tritium has a half-life of 12.5 y undergoing beta decay.
What fraction of a sample of pure tritium will remain undecayed
after 25 y.

Solution

By definition of half-life, half of the initial sample will remain
undecayed after 12.5 y. In the next 125 y, one-half of these nuclei
would have decayed. Hence, one fourth of the sample of the initial

pure tritium will remain undecayed.

13.6.2 Alpha decay

A well-known example of alpha decay is the decay of uranium 2S’SUto
thorium 233 Th with the emission of a helium nucleus 3 He

2§§U —> 233111 + 3 He (cc-decay) (I 3.1 9)

In oc-decay, the mass number of the product nucleus (daughter
nucleus) is four less than that of the decaying nucleus (parent nucleus),
while the atomic number decreases by two. In general, oc-decay of a parent
nucleus 2X results in a daughter nucleus :‘gY

2x » 1::Y + :He “3-20)

From Einstein’s mass-energy equivalance relation [Eq. (13.6)] and
energy conservation, it is clear that this spontaneous decay is possible
only when the total mass of the decay products is less than the mass of

the initial nucleus. This difference in mass appears as kinetic energy of
the products. By referring to a table of nuclear masses, one can check

that the total mass of 233111 and 3He is indeed less than that of 2§§U.

The disintegration energy or the Q—Value of a nuclear reaction is the
difference between the initial mass energy and the total mass energy of
the decay products. For oc-decay

Q=(mX—my— rnHe)c2 (13.21)

Q is also the net kinetic energy gained in the process or, if the initial
nucleus X is at rest, the kinetic energy of the products. Clearly, Q> O for
exothermic processes such as oc-decay.
