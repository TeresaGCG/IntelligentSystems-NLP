So, we have £/V= 11/12 [3.94(a)]
But, 8 = I (r + R) and V= IR. This gives
8/V= (r+R)/R [3.94(b)]

From Eq. [3.94(a)] and [3.94(b)] we have
(R+r)/R = 11/12

r = R[l—1- 1] (3.95)

Using Eq. (3.95) we can find the internal resistance of a given cell.

The potentiometer has the advantage that it draws no current from
the voltage source being measured. As such it is unaffected by the internal
resistance of the source.

Example 3.10 A resistance of R 9 draws current from a
potentiometer. The potentiometer has a total resistance RO S2
(Fig. 3.29). A voltage V is supplied to the potentiometer. Derive an
expression for the voltage across R when the sliding contact is in the
middle of the potentiometer.

FIGURE 3.29

Solution While the slide is in the middle of the potentiometer only
half of its resistance (R0/ 2) will be between the points A and B. Hence,
the total resistance between A and B, say, R1, will be given by the
following expression:

 

 

i=l+ 1

R R (Re/2)

R1: ROR
R0+2R

The total resistance between A and C will be sum of resistance between
A and B and B and C, Le, R1 + RO/Z
The current ﬂowing through the potentiometer will be

I=—=—
R1+R0/2 2R1+R0

The voltage V1 taken from the potentiometer will be the product of
current I and resistance R1,
