If we have a continuous charge distribution characterised by a charge
density p (r), we divide it, as before, into small volume elements each of
size AU and carrying a charge pAv. We then determine the potential due
to each volume element and sum (strictly speaking , integrate) over all
such contributions, and thus determine the potential due to the entire
distribution.

We have seen in Chapter 1 that for a uniformly charged spherical shell,
the electric ﬁeld outside the shell is as if the entire charge is concentrated
at the centre. Thus, the potential outside the shell is given by

1 q
471.90 ; (r 2 R) [2.19(a)]

V:

 

where q is the total charge on the shell and R its radius. The electric field
inside the shell is zero. This implies (Section 2.6) that potential is constant
inside the shell (as no work is done in moving a charge inside the shell),
and, therefore, equals its value at the surface, which is

V = 1 q

Example 2.2 Two charges 3 X 10'8 C and —2 X 10‘8 C are located
15 cm apart. At what point on the line joining the two charges is the
electric potential zero? Take the potential at infinity to be zero.

Solution Let us take the origin 0 at the location of the positive charge.
The line joining the two charges is taken to be the x-axis; the negative
charge is taken to be on the right side of the origin (Fig. 2.7).

Let P be the required point on the x-axis where the potential is zero.
If x is the x-coordinate of P, obviously x must be positive. (There is no
possibility of potentials due to the two charges adding up to zero for
x < 0.) If x lies between 0 and A, we have
