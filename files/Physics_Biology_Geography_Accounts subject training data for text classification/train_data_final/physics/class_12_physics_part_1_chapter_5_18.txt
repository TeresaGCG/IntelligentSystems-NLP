Example 5.10 A solenoid has a core of a material with relative
permeability 400. The windings of the solenoid are insulated from the
core and carry a current of 2A. If the number of turns is 1000 per
metre, calculate (a) H, (b) M, (c) B and (d) the magnetising current Im.

Solution
(a) The field H is dependent of the material of the core, and is
H= nI= 1000 x 2.0 = 2 X103A/m.
(b) The magnetic field B is given by
B = ,ur yo H
= 400 x 41: x10‘7 (N/A2) x 2 x 103 (A/m)
= 1.0 T
(c) Magnetisation is given by
M = (B- #o H)/ #0
= (M10 H—uo Hl/uO = Utr- 1)H= 399 X H
E 8 X 105 A/m
(d) The magnetising current IM is the additional current that needs
to be passed through the windings of the solenoid in the absence
of the core which would give a B value as in the presence of the

core. Thus B = yrno (I+ 1M). Using I= 2A, B = 1 T, we get IM = 794 A.

5.6 MAGNETIC PROPERTIES OF MATERIALS

The discussion in the previous section helps us to classify materials as
diamagnetic, paramagnetic or ferromagnetic. In terms of the susceptibility
x, a material is diamagnetic if x is negative, para— if x is positive and
small, and ferro- if x is large and positive.

A glance at Table 5.3 gives one a better feeling for these
materials. Here 8 is a small positive number introduced to quantify

paramagnetic materials. Next, we describe these materials in some
detail. 191
