2. 1 INTRODUCTION

Measurement of any physical quantity involves comparison
with a certain basic, arbitrarily chosen, internationally
accepted reference standard called unit. The result of a
measurement of a physical quantity is expressed by a
number (or numerical measure) accompanied by a unit.
Although the number of physical quantities appears to be
very large, we need only a limited number of units for
expressing all the physical quantities, since they are inter-
related with one another. The units for the fundamental or
base quantities are called fundamental or base units. The
units of all other physical quantities can be expressed as
combinations of the base units. Such units obtained for the
derived quantities are called derived units. A complete set
of these units, both the base units and derived units, is
known as the system of units.

2.2 THE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM OF UNITS
In earlier time scientists of different countries were using
different systems of units for measurement. Three such
systems, the CGS, the FPS (or British) system and the MKS
system were in use extensively till recently.

The base units for length, mass and time in these systems
were as follows :
0 In CGS system they were centimetre, gram and second

respectively.

0 In FPS system they were foot, pound and second
respectively.

0 In MKS system they were metre, kilogram and second
respectively.

The system of units which is at present internationally
accepted for measurement is the Systeme Internationale
dâ€™ Unites (French for International System of Units),
abbreviated as SI. The SI, with standard scheme of symbols,
units and abbreviations, was developed and recommended
by General Conference on Weights and Measures in 197 1 for
