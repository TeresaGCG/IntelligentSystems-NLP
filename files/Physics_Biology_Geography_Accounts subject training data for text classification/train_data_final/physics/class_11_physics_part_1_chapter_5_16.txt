Comparing this with Eq. (5.18) we see that
maximum possible speed of a car on a banked
road is greater than that on a ﬂat road.

For us: 0 in Eq. (5.21 ),
v0 = {Rg tan 9)”: (5.22)

At this speed, frictional force is not needed at all
to provide the necessary centripetal force.
Driving at this speed on a banked road will cause
little wear and tear of the tyres. The same
equation also tells you that for v < v0, frictional
force will be up the slope and that a car can be
parked only if tan 0 S #5-

} Example 5.10 A cyclist speeding at
18 km/h on a level road takes a sharp
circular turn of radius 3 m without reducing

the speed. The co-efﬁcient of static friction
between the tyres and the road is 0.]. Will
the cyclist slip while taking the turn?

 

Answer On an unbanked road, frictional force
alone can provide the centripetal force needed
to keep the cyclist moving on a circular turn
without slipping. If the speed is too large, or if
the turn is too sharp (i.e. of too small a radius)
or both, the frictional force is not sufficient to
provide the necessary centripetal force, and the
cyclist slips. The condition for the cyclist not to
slip is given by Eq. (5.18) :

v2 S 1,1ng

Now, R = 3 m, g = 9.8 m s2, us = 0.1. That is,
us R9 = 2.94 m2 s2. 1) = 18 km/h = 5 m S'l,‘ i.e.,
v2 = 25 m2 s2. The condition is not obeyed.

The cyclist will slip while taking the circular
turn. 4

 

D Example 5.11 A circular racetrack of
radius 300 m is banked at an angle of 15°.
If the coefficient of friction between the
wheels of a racevcar and the road is 0.2.
what is the (a) optimum speed of the race—
car to avoid wear and tear on its tyres, and
(b) maximum permissible speed to avoid

slipping ‘?

 

Answer On a banked road, the horizontal
component of the normal force and the frictional
force contribute to provide centripetal force to
keep the car moving on a circular turn without
slipping. At the optimum speed, the normal
reaction’s component is enough to provide the
needed centripetal force, and the frictional force
is not needed. The optimum speed U0 is given by
Eq. (5.22):

v0 = {Rg tan of”
Here R = 300 m, 0 = 15°, 9 = 9.8 m s2; we
have

v0 = 28.1 mS'l.

The maximum permissible speed um is given by
Eq. (5.2 1):

5. 1 1 SOLVING PROBLEMS IN MECHANICS

The three laws of motion that you have learnt in
this chapter are the foundation of mechanics.
You should now be able to handle a large variety
of problems in mechanics. A typical problem in
mechanics usually does not merely involve a
single body under the action of given forces.
More often, we will need to consider an assembly
of different bodies exerting forces on each other.
Besides, each body in the assembly experiences
the force of gravity. When trying to solve a
problem of this type, it is useful to remember
the fact that we can choose any part of the
assembly and apply the laws of motion to that
part provided we include all forces on the chosen
part due to the remaining parts of the assembly.
We may call the chosen part of the assembly as
the system and the remaining part of the
assembly (plus any other agencies of forces) as
the environment. We have followed the same
