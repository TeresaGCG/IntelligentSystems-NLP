4—Earth’s surface

Fig. 8. 7 The mass m is in a mine located at a depth
d below the surface of the Earth of mass
ME and radius RE. We treat the Earth to be

spherically symmetric.

Again consider the earth to be made up of
concentric shells as before and a point mass m
situated at a distance r from the centre. The
point P lies outside the sphere of radius r. For
the shells of radius greater than r, the point P
lies inside. Hence according to result stated in
the last section, they exert no gravitational force
on mass m kept at P. The shells with radius 3 r
make up a sphere of radius r for which the point
P lies on the surface. This smaller sphere
therefore exerts a force on a mass m at P as if
its mass Mris concentrated at the centre. Thus
the force on the mass m at P has a magnitude

We assume that the entire earth is of uniform

density and hence its mass is ME = g R: p

where ME is the mass of the earth RE is its radius
and p is the density. On the other hand the

If the mass m is situated on the surface of

The acceleration experienced by the mass m,
which is usually denoted by the symbol 9 is
related to F by Newton’s 2“ law by relation
F= mg. Thus
_ F _ GM E
_ m _ R;

Acceleration 9 is readily measurable. RE is a
known quantity. The measurement of G by
Cavendish’s experiment (or otherwise), combined
with knowledge of g and RE enables one to
estimate ME from Eq. (8. 12). This is the reason

why there is a popular statement regarding
Cavendish : “Cavendish weighed the earth”.

8.6 ACCELERATION DUE TO GRAVITY
BELOW AND ABOVE THE SURFACE OF
EARTH

Consider a point mass m at a height h above the
surface of the earth as shown in Fig. 8.8(a). The
radius of the earth is denoted by RE. Since this
point is outside the earth,

/ Earth's surface

Fig. 8.8 (a) g at a height h above the surface of the
earth.

its distance from the centre of the earth is (RE +
h). If F(h) denoted the magnitude of the force
on the point mass m , we get from Eq. (8.5) :

F(h) _ GMEm

_ m (8.13)

The acceleration experienced by the point
mass is F(h)/ ng(h) and we get
