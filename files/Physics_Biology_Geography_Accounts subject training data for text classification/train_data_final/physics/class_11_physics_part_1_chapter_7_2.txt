Fig. 7.4 A rigid body rotation about the z—axis (Each
point of the body such as P1 or
P2 describes a circle with its centre (C 1

or C2) on the axis of rotation. The radius of

the circle (rlor r2) is the perpendicular
distance of the point (P1 or P2) from the
axis. A point on the axis like P3 remains
stationary).

every particle of the body moves in a circle,
which lies in a plane perpendicular to the axis
and has its centre on the axis. Fig. 7 .4 shows
the rotational motion of a rigid body about a fixed
axis (the z—axis of the frame of reference). Let P1
be a particle of the rigid body, arbitrarily chosen
and at a distance r1 from fixed axis. The particle
P1 describes a circle of radius r1 with its centre
C1 on the fixed axis. The circle lies in a plane
perpendicular to the axis. The figure also shows
another particle P2 of the rigid body, P2 is at a
distance r2 from the fixed axis. The particle P2
moves in a circle of radius r2 and with centre C2
on the axis. This circle, too, lies in a plane
perpendicular to the axis. Note that the circles
described by P1 and P2 may lie in different planes;
both these planes, however, are perpendicular
to the fixed axis. For any particle on the axis
like P3, r = 0. Any such particle remains
stationary while the body rotates. This is
expected since the axis of rotation is fixed.

(The point of contact of the top with the
ground, its tip 0, is ﬁxed.)

Axis of oscillation

 

Fig. 7.5 (b) An oscillating table fan with rotating
blades. The pivot of the fan, point 0, is
ﬁxed. The blades of the fan are under
rotational motion, whereas, the axis of

rotation of the fan blades is oscillating.

In some examples of rotation, however, the
axis may not be fixed. A prominent example of
this kind of rotation is a top spinning in place
[Fig. 7.5(a)]. (We assume that the top does not
slip from place to place and so does not have
translational motion.) We know from experience
that the axis of such a spinning top moves
around the vertical through its point of contact
with the ground, sweeping out a cone as shown
in Fig. 7 .5(a). (This movement of the axis of the
top around the vertical is termed precession.)
Note, the point of contact of the top with
ground is fixed. The axis of rotation of the top
at any instant passes through the point of
contact. Another simple example of this kind of
rotation is the oscillating table fan or a pedestal
fan [Fig.7 .5(b)]. You may have observed that the
