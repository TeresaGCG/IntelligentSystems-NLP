EXERCISES

A small candle, 2.5 cm in size is placed at 27 cm in front of a concave
mirror of radius of curvature 36 cm. At what distance from the mirror
should a screen be placed in order to obtain a sharp image? Describe
the nature and size of the image. If the candle is moved closer to the
mirror, how would the screen have to be moved?

A 4.5 cm needle is placed 12 cm away from a convex mirror of focal
length 15 cm. Give the location of the image and the magnification.
Describe what happens as the needle is moved farther from the mirror.
A tank is filled with water to a height of 12.5 cm. The apparent
depth of a needle lying at the bottom of the tank is measured by a
microscope to be 9.4 cm. What is the refractive index of water? If
water is replaced by a liquid of refractive index 1.63 up to the same
height, by what distance would the microscope have to be moved to
focus on the needle again?

Figures 9.31(a) and (b) show refraction of a ray in air incident at 60°
with the normal to a glass-air and water-air interface, respectively.
Predict the angle of refraction in glass when the angle of incidence
in water is 45° with the normal to a water-glass interface [Fig. 9.3 1 (c)].

FIGURE 9.3 1

A small bulb is placed at the bottom of a tank containing water to a
depth of 80cm. What is the area of the surface of water through
which light from the bulb can emerge out? Refractive index of water
is 1.33. (Consider the bulb to be a point source.)

A prism is made of glass of unknown refractive index. A parallel
beam of light is incident on a face of the prism. The angle of minimum
deviation is measured to be 40°. What is the refractive index of the
material of the prism? The refracting angle of the prism is 60°. If the
prism is placed in water (refractive index 1.33), predict the new
angle of minimum deviation of a parallel beam of light.

Double-convex lenses are to be manufactured from a glass of
refractive index 1.55, with both faces of the same radius of
curvature. What is the radius of curvature required if the focal length
is to be 20cm?

A beam of light converges at a point P. Now a lens is placed in the
path of the convergent beam 12cm from P. At what point does the
beam converge if the lens is (a) a convex lens of focal length 20 cm,
and (b) a concave lens of focal length 16cm?

An object of size 3.0cm is placed 14cm in front of a concave lens of
focal length 21cm. Describe the image produced by the lens. What
happens if the object is moved further away from the lens?
