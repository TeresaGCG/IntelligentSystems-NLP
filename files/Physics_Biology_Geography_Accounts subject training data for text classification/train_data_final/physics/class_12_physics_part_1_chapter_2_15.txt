(c) Suppose that the same system of charges is now placed in an
external electric field E = A (1/r2); A = 9 X 105 C m'2. What would
the electrostatic energy of the configuration be?

Solution

(a) U: 1 ‘1qu = 9x109 XM= —0.7 J.
47:80 r 0.18
(b) W= UZ—U1 =O—U=O—(—O.7) =O.7J.
(c) The mutual interaction energy of the two charges remains
unchanged. In addition, there is the energy of interaction of the
two charges with the external electric ﬁeld. We ﬁnd,

V V : A A
ql (r1) + ‘12 (r2) 0.09m + 0.09m

and the net electrostatic energy is

2.8.3 Potential energy of a dipole in an external ﬁeld

Consider a dipole with charges q1 = +q and q2 = —q placed in a uniform
electric field E, as shown in Fig. 2.16.

As seen in the last chapter, in a uniform electric ﬁeld,
the dipole experiences no net force; but experiences a
_, torque 1: given by

’ 1: = pXE (2.30)
which will tend to rotate it (unless p is parallel or
antiparallel to E). Suppose an external torque text is
V x applied in such a manner that it just neutralises this
torque and rotates it in the plane of paper from angle 00
to angle 01 at an infinitesimal angular speed and without
. . angular acceleration. The amount of work done by the
‘ external torque will be given by

dipole in a uniform external field.

= pE(cos490 —cos6?1) (2.31)

This work is stored as the potential energy of the system. We can then
associate potential energy U(6) with an inclination 6 of the dipole. Similar
to other potential energies, there is a freedom in choosing the angle where
the potential energy U is taken to be zero. A natural choice is to take
00 = at / 2. (An explanation for it is provided towards the end of discussion.)
We can then write,

66 U(6) = pE (cos; — cosej = pE cos6 = —p.E (2.32)
