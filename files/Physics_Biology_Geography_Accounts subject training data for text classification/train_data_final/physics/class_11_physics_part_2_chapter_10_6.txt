is the mechanical advantage of the device. The
example below clarifies it.

behind the hydraulic lift, a device used to
lift heavy loads.

Example 10.5 Two syringes of different
cross-sections (without needles) ﬁlled with
water are connected with a tightly ﬁtted
rubber tube filled with water. Diameters of
the smaller piston and larger piston are 1.0
cm and 3.0 cm respectively. (a) Find the
force exerted on the larger piston when a
force of 10 N is applied to the smaller piston.
(b) If the smaller piston is pushed in through
6.0 cm, how much does the larger piston
move out?

 

Answer (a) Since pressure is transmitted
undiminished throughout the ﬂuid,

(b) Water is considered to be perfectly
incompressible. Volume covered by the
movement of smaller piston inwards is equal to
volume moved outwards due to the larger piston.

Note, atmospheric pressure is common to both
pistons and has been ignored. 4

Example 1 0.6 In a car lift compressed air
exerts a force F1 on a small piston having
a radius of 5.0 cm. This pressure is
transmitted to a second piston of radius

15 cm (Fig 10.7). If the mass of the car to
be lifted is 1350 kg, calculate Fl. What is
the pressure necessary to accomplish this

task? (g = 9.8 mS'Z).

 

Answer Since pressure is transmitted
undiminished throughout the ﬂuid,

X —2 2
F1 = ﬁg = W (1350kg x9.8ms‘2)
= 1470N
z 1.5x 103N

The air pressure that will produce this
force is

This is almost double the atmospheric
pressure. 4
Hydraulic brakes in automobiles also work on
the same principle. When we apply a little force
on the pedal with our foot the master piston

Archimedes was a Greek philosopher. mathematician, scientist and engineer. He
invented the catapult and devised a system of pulleys and levers to handle heavy
loads. The king of his native city Syracuse. Hiero II. asked him to determine if his gold

crown was alloyed with some cheaper metal, such as silver without damaging the crown.
. The partial loss of we1ght he experienced while lying 1n his bathtub suggested a solution
to him. According to legend he ran naked through the streets of Syracuse exclaiming “.Eureka
eureka!‘. which means "I have found it. I have found it!"
