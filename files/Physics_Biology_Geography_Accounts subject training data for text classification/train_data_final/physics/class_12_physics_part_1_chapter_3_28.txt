standard known resistance S. The jockey is connected to some point D
on the wire, a distance 1 cm from the end A. The jockey can be moved
along the wire. The portion AD of the wire has a resistance Rcml, where
Rcm is the resistance of the wire per unit centimetre. The portion DC of
the wire similarly has a resistance Rem (100-1).

The four arms AB, BC, DA and CD [with resistances R, S, RCm land
Rcm(100-l)] obviously form a Wheatstone bridge with AC as the battery
arm and BD the galvanometer arm. If the jockey is moved along the wire,
then there will be one position where the galvanometer will show no
current. Let the distance of the jockey from the end A at the balance
point be l= 11- The four resistances of the bridge at the balance point then
are R, S, RCm l1 and Rcm(lOO—ll). The balance condition, Eq. [3.83(a)]

gives
R R l1 11

CT".

S=Rcm (100—1,)=100—l1 (3-85)
Thus, once we have found out ll, the unknown resistance R is known
in terms of the standard known resistance S by

11

R=S —
100—11 (3'86)

By choosing various values of S, we would get various values of ll,
and calculate R each time. An error in measurement of 11 would naturally
result in an error in R. It can be shown that the percentage error in R can
be minimised by adjusting the balance point near the middle of the
bridge, i.e., when 11 is close to 50 cm. (This requires a suitable choice
of S.)

 

Example 3.9 In a meter bridge (Fig. 3.27), the null point is found at a
distance of 33.7 cm from A. If now a resistance of 1252 is connected in
parallel with S, the null point occurs at 51.9 cm. Determine the values
of R and S.

Solution From the ﬁrst balance point, we get

R _ 33.7

After S is connected in parallel with a resistance of 12S) , the resistance
across the gap changes from S to Seq, where
_ 125
W _ s + 12
and hence the new balance condition now gives

51.9 _3_ R(S+12)
48.l_S ' 125 (388)

eq

Substituting the value of R/ S from Eq. (3.87), we get

51.9 _ S+12 33.7

m_ 12 'E
which gives S = 13.59. Using the value of R/S above, we get
R = 6.86 9.
