Since force is a vector, it is better to write
Coulomb’s law in the vector notation. Let the
position vectors of charges q1 and q2 be I1 and 1'2
respectively [see Fig. 1.6(a)]. We denote force on
q1 due to q2 by F12 and force on q2 due to q1 by
F21. The two point charges q1 and q2 have been
numbered 1 and 2 for convenience and the vector
leading from 1 to 2 is denoted by r21:

r V r21 = r2 — r1

q 2', , e ’ F21 In the same way, the vector leading from 2 to

direction of a vector is speciﬁed by a unit vector
along the vector. To denote the direction from 1
to 2 (or from 2 to 1), we define the unit vectors:

Coulomb’s force law between two point charges q1 and q2 located at

1'1 and 1'2 is then expressed as

Some remarks on Eq. (1.3) are relevant:

Equation (1.3) is valid for any sign of q1 and q2 whether positive or
negative. If q1 and q2 are of the same sign (either both positive or both

negative), F21 is along i' 21, which denotes repulsion, as it should be for

like charges. If q1 and q2 are of opposite signs, F21 is along — ?21(= ?12 ,
which denotes attraction, as expected for unlike charges. Thus, we do
not have to write separate equations for the cases of like and unlike
charges. Equation (1.3) takes care of both cases correctly [Fig. 1.603)].

The force F12 on charge q1 due to charge q2, is obtained from Eq. (1.3),
by simply interchanging 1 and 2, i.e.,

1 Q1Q2 A

Thus, Coulomb’s law agrees with the Newton’s third law.

Coulomb’s law [Eq. (1.3)] gives the force between two charges q1 and
q2 in vacuum. If the charges are placed in matter or the intervening
space has matter, the situation gets complicated due to the presence
of charged constituents of matter. We shall consider electrostatics in
matter in the next chapter.
