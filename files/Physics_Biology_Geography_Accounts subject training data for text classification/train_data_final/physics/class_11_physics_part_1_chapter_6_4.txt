object can do by the virtue of its motion. This
notion has been intuitively known for a long time.
The kinetic energy of a fast ﬂowing stream
has been used to grind corn. Sailing
ships employ the kinetic energy of the wind. Table
6.2 lists the kinetic energies for various
objects.

 

b Example 6.4 In a ballistics demonstration
a police officer fires a bullet of mass 50.0 g
with speed 200 m 3’1 (see Table 6.2) on soft
plywood of thickness 2.00 cm. The bullet
emerges with only 10% of its initial kinetic
energy. What is the emergent speed of the
bullet ‘?

 

Answer The initial kinetic energy of the bullet
is mv2/ 2 = 1000 J. It has a final kinetic energy
of 0. 1x1000 = 100 J. If of is the emergent speed
of the bullet,

6.5 WORK DONE BY A VARIABLE FORCE

A constant force is rare. It is the variable force,
which is more commonly encountered. Fig. 6.3
is a plot of a varying force in one dimension.

If the displacement Axis small, we can take
the force F(x) as approximately constant and
the work done is then

AW =F(x) Ax

Car 2000 25 53x105
Running athlete 70 10 3 .5 x 103

Air molecule 2 10'26 500 z 10'21

 
   

This is illustrated in Fig. 6.3(a). Adding
successive rectangular areas in Fig. 6.3(a) we
get the total work done as

xf
WeZF(x)Ax (6.6)

where the summation is from the initial position

xi to the final position xf

If the displacements are allowed to approach
zero, then the number of terms in the sum
increases without limit, but the sum approaches
a deﬁnite value equal to the area under the curve
in Fig. 6.3(b). Then the work done is

=IFWMM ww

where ‘lim’ stands for the limit of the sum when
Ax tends to zero. Thus, for a varying force
the work done can be expressed as a definite
integral of force over displacement (see also
Appendix 3. 1).
