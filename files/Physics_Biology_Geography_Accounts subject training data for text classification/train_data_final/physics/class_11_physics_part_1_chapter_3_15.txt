parallel to the time axis. For motion with uniform acceleration, x—t graph is a parabola
while the v—t graph is a straight line inclined to the time axis.

10. The area under the velocity—time curve between times t1 and t2 is equal to the displacement
of the object during that interval of time.

1 1. For objects in unifome accelerated rectilinear motion, the five quantities, displacement
x, time taken t, initial velocity v0, final velocity v and acceleration a are related by a set
of simple equations called kinematic equations of motion :

v=v0+ at

x=v0t+—at

v :v0+2ax

if the position of the object at time t = 0 is 0. If the particle starts at x = x0 , x in above
equations is replaced by [x — x0).
