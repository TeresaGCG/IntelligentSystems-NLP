A given coin has a mass of 3.0 g. Calculate the nuclear energy that
would be required to separate all the neutrons and protons from
each other. For simplicity assume that the coin is entirely made of

SSCu atoms (of mass 62.92960 u).

A radioactive isotope has a half-life of Tyears. How long will it take
the activity to reduce to a) 3.125%, b) 1% of its original value?

The normal activity of living carbon-containing matter is found to
be about 15 decays per minute for every gram of carbon. This activity

arises from the small proportion of radioactive 13C present with the

stable carbon isotope 1:0 . When the organism is dead, its interaction

with the atmosphere (which maintains the above equilibrium activity)
ceases and its activity begins to drop. From the known half-life (5730

years) of 12C, and the measured activity, the age of the specimen
can be approximately estimated. This is the principle of 1:31 C dating
