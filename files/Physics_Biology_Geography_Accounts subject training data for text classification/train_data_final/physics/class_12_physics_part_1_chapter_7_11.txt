The peak current is

in. = £1 = (l.41)(1.04A) = 1.4m
This current oscillates between +1.47A and —l.47 A. and is ahead of
the voltage by 71/ 2.

If the frequency is doubled. the capacitive reactance is halved and
consequently. the current is doubled.

EXAMPLE 7.4

Example 7.5 A light bulb and an open coil inductor are connected to
an ac source through a key as shown in Fig. 7.1 1.

FIGURE 7. 1 1

The switch is closed and after sometime. an iron rod is inserted into
the interior of the inductor. The glow of the light bulb (a) increases: (b)
decreases; (c) is unchanged. as the iron rod is inserted. Give your
answer with reasons.

Solution As the iron rod is inserted. the magnetic field inside the coil
magnetizes the iron increasing the magnetic field inside it. Hence.
the inductance of the coil increases. Consequently. the inductive
reactance of the coil increases. As a result. a larger fraction of the
applied ac voltage appears across the inductor. leaving less voltage
across the bulb. Therefore. the glow of the light bulb decreases.
