The lowest energy level in the
conduction band is shown as EC and
highest energy level in the valence band
is shown as EV. Above EC and below EV
there are a large number of closely spaced
energy levels, as shown in Fig. 14.1.

The gap between the top of the valence
band and bottom of the conduction band
is called the energy band gap (Energy gap
Eg). It may be large, small, or zero,
depending upon the material. These
different situations, are depicted in Fig.
14.2 and discussed below:

Case I: This refers to a situation, as
shown in Fig. 14.2(a). One can have a
metal either when the conduction band
is partially ﬁlled and the balanced band
is partially empty or when the conduction
and valance bands overlap. When there
is overlap electrons from valence band can
easily move into the conduction band.

This situation makes a large number of

electrons available for electrical conduction. When the valence band is
partially empty, electrons from its lower level can move to higher level
making conduction possible. Therefore, the resistance of such materials

is low or the conductivity is high.
