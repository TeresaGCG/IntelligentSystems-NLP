microscope or magnifier, produces the ﬁnal image, which is enlarged
and virtual. The ﬁrst inverted image is thus near (at or within) the focal
plane of the eyepiece, at a distance appropriate for ﬁnal image formation
at inﬁnity, or a little closer for image formation at the near point. Clearly,
the ﬁnal image is inverted with respect to the original object.

We now obtain the magniﬁcation due to a compound microscope.
The ray diagram of Fig. 9.28 shows that the (linear) magniﬁcation due to
the objective, namely h’ / h, equals

.m _ h’ _ i

o — h — f0 (9.43)

 

where we have used the result

h h’

tang—[f,]_(Lj

Here h’ is the size of the ﬁrst image, the object size being h and f0
being the focal length of the objective. The ﬁrst image is formed near the
focal point of the eyepiece. The distance L, i.e., the distance between the
second focal point of the objective and the ﬁrst focal point of the eyepiece
(focal length j; ) is called the tube length of the compound microscope.

As the ﬁrst inverted image is near the focal point of the eyepiece, we
use the result from the discussion above for the simple microscope to

obtain the (angular) magniﬁcation me due to it [Eq. (9.39)], when the
final image is formed at the near point, is

D
me = [1 + T] [9.44(a)]
