Equation (1.30) is a simple illustration of a general result of
electrostatics called Gauss’s law.

We state Gauss’s law without proof:

Electric ﬂux through a closed surface S

= q / 80 (1.3 1)

q = total charge enclosed by S.

The law implies that the total electric ﬂux through a closed surface is
zero if no charge is enclosed by the surface. We can see that explicitly in
the simple situation of Fig. 1.26.

Here the electric ﬁeld is uniform and we are considering a closed
cylindrical surface, with its axis parallel to the uniform field E. The total
ﬂux ¢ through the surface is ¢ = $1 + $2 + ¢3, where ¢1 and $2 represent
the ﬂux through the surfaces 1 and 2 (of circular cross-section) of the
cylinder and $3 is the ﬂux through the curved cylindrical part of the
closed surface. Now the normal to the surface 3 at every point is
perpendicular to E, so by deﬁnition of ﬂux, $3 = 0. Further, the outward
normal to 2 is along E while the outward normal to 1 is opposite to E.
Therefore,

¢1=_ES1’ ¢2=+E52
S1 = S2 = S

where S is the area of circular cross-section. Thus, the total ﬂux is zero,

as expected by Gauss’s law. Thus, whenever you find that the net electric

ﬂux through a closed surface is zero, we conclude that the total charge
contained in the closed surface is zero.

The great significance of Gauss’s law Eq. (1.31), is that it is true in
general, and not only for the simple cases we have considered above. Let
us note some important points regarding this law:

(i) Gauss’s law is true for any closed surface, no matter what its shape
or Size.

(ii) The term q on the right side of Gauss’s law, Eq. (1 .31), includes the
sum of all charges enclosed by the surface. The charges may be located
anywhere inside the surface.

(iii) In the situation when the surface is so chosen that there are some
charges inside and some outside, the electric ﬁeld [whose ﬂux appears

on the left side of Eq. (1.3 1)] is due to all the charges, both inside and
outside S. The term q on the right side of Gauss’s law, however,

represents only the total charge inside S.
