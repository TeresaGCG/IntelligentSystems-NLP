Now, integrating both sides of the above equation,we get,

or, lnN —lnN0=—)t(t—t0) (13.12)

Here N0 is the number of radioactive nuclei in the sample at some
arbitrary time t0 and N is the number of radioactive nuclei at any
subsequent time t. Setting t0 = 0 and rearranging Eq. (13.12) gives us

1n1 = —/it (13.13)
NO

which gives
N(t) =N0e’“ (13.14)

Note, for example, the light bulbs follow no such exponential decay law.
If we test 1000 bulbs for their life (time span before they burn out or
fuse), we expect that they will ‘decay’ (that is, burn out) at more or less
the same time. The decay of radionuclides follows quite a different law,
the law of radioactive decay represented by Eq. (13.14).

The total decay rate R of a sample is the number of nuclei
disintegrating per unit time. Suppose in a time interval dt, the decay
count measured is AN. Then dN = — AN.

The positive quantity R is then deﬁned as

y
—v

Differentiating Eq. (13. 14), we get

R — AND e

or, R =R0e"It (13.15)

Number of undeca ed nuclei

 

This is equivalant to the law of radioactivity decay,
since you can integrate Eq. (13. 15) to get back Eq. T1,2 2T1,2 3T1,2 4T1,2 m
(13.14). Clearly, R0 = XNO is the decay rate at t= 0. The
decay rate R at a certain time t and the number of
undecayed nuclei N at the same time are related by

The decay rate of a sample, rather than the number of radioactive
nuclei, is a more direct experimentally measurable quantity and is given
a specific name: activity. The SI unit for activity is becquerel, named

after the discoverer of radioactivity, Henry Becquerel. 447
