X m1 + m2 + m3 Answer Choosing the X and Yaxes as shown

in Fig. 7.1 1 we have the coordinates of the

100(0) + 150(0.5) + 200(0-25) gm vertices of the L-shaped lamina as given in the

Z (100 + 150 + 200) g figure. We can think of the

L—shape to consist of 3 squares each of length

75 + 50 125 5 1m. The mass of each square is 1kg, since the

= 450 m = 4—50m = Em lamina is uniform. The centres of mass C1, C2

and C3 of the squares are, by symmetry, their

100(0) + 150(0) + 200(0.25\/§) gm geometric centres and have coordinates (1 / 2, 1 / 2),

Y = 450 g (3/2,1/2), (1/2,3/2) respectively. We take the

masses of the squares to be concentrated at

50 J3 J§ 1 these points. The centre of mass of the whole

2 —m = —m = —m L shape (X, Y) is the centre of mass of these
450 9 3‘5

mass points.
The centre of mass C is shown in the figure.

Note that it is not the geometric centre of the
triangle OAB. Why? 4

P Example 7.2 Find the centre of mass ofa
triangular lamina.

Answer The lamina (ALMN) may be subdivided
into narrow strips each parallel to the base (MN)
as shown in Fig. 7.10

Hence

By symmetry each strip has its centre of [1(1/2)+ 1(1/2)+ ”3/2” kgm 5
mass at its midpoint. If we join the midpoint of Y = 1 1 1 k = 6 m
all the strips we get the median LP. The centre ( + + ) g
of mass of the triangle as awhole therefore, has The centre of mass of the L—shape lies on

to lie on the median LP. Similarly, we can argue the line OD. We could have guessed this without
that it lies on the median Mg and NR. This calculations. Can you tell why? Suppose, the
means the centre of mass lies on the point of three squares that make up the L shaped lamina
