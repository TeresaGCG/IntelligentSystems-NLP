Electrostatic Potential

and Capacitance

 

An electrical technician requires a capacitance of 2 ”F in a circuit
across a potential difference of 1 kV. Alarge number of 1 “F capacitors
are available to him each of which can withstand a potential
difference of not more than 400 V. Suggest a possible arrangement
that requires the minimum number of capacitors.

What is the area of the plates of a 2 F parallel plate capacitor, given
that the separation between the plates is 0.5 cm? [You will realise
from your answer why ordinary capacitors are in the range of “F or
less. However, electrolytic capacitors do have a much larger
capacitance (0.1 F) because of very minute separation between the
conductors]

Obtain the equivalent capacitance of the network in Fig. 2.33. For a
300 V supply, determine the charge and voltage across each
capacitor.

FIGURE 2.33

The plates of a parallel plate capacitor have an area of 90 cm2 each
and are separated by 2.5 mm. The capacitor is charged by
connecting it to a 400 V supply.

(a) How much electrostatic energy is stored by the capacitor?

(b) View this energr as stored in the electrostatic field between
the plates, and obtain the energy per unit volume u. Hence
arrive at a relation between u and the magnitude of electric
field E between the plates.

A 4 uF capacitor is charged by a 200 V supply. It is then disconnected
from the supply, and is connected to another uncharged 2 11F
capacitor. How much electrostatic energy of the first capacitor is
lost in the form of heat and electromagnetic radiation?

Show that the force on each plate of a parallel plate capacitor has a
magnitude equal to (1/2) QE, where Q is the charge on the capacitor,
and E is the magnitude of electric field between the plates. Explain
the origin of the factor 1/2.
