SYSTEMS OF PARTICLES AND ROTATIONAL MOTION

I71

1 = I a (7.43)

Eq. (7.43) is similar to Newton’s second law
for linear motion expressed symbolically as

F = ma

Just as force produces acceleration, torque
produces angular acceleration in a body. The
angular acceleration is directly proportional to
the applied torque and is inversely proportional
to the moment of inertia of the body. In this
respect, Eq.(7 .43) can be called Newton’s second
law for rotational motion about a fixed axis.

P Example 7.15 A cord of negligible mass
is wound round the rim of a ﬂy wheel of
mass 20 kg and radius 20 cm. A steady
pull of 25 N is applied on the cord as shown
in Fig. 7.35. The ﬂywheel is mounted on a
horizontal axle with frictionless bearings.

(a) Compute the angular acceleration of

the wheel.

(b) Find the work done by the pull, when
2m of the cord is unwound.

(c) Find also the kinetic energy of the
wheel at this point. Assume that the
wheel starts from rest.

 

((1) Compare answers to parts (b) and ((3).

Answer

 

F=25N

Fig. 7.35

(a) We use I 06 = T
the torque ‘L' = F R

= 25 X 0.20 Nm (as R = 0.20m)
= 5.0 Nm

I = Moment of inertia of ﬂywheel about its

 

axis —MR2

a = angular acceleration
= 5.0 N m/0.4 kg m2 = 12.5 s—2
(b) Work done by the pull unwinding 2m of the
cord

= 25 N X 2m = 50 J
(e) Let a) be the final angular velocity. The

kinetic energy gained = 51602 ,
since the wheel starts from rest. Now,
(02 = (03‘ + 20:6, we = O

The angular displacement 9 = length of

unwound string / radius of wheel
= 2m/0.2 m = 10 rad

(02 = 2 x 12.5 x 10.0 = 250(rad/s)2

K.E. gained: éx0.4x250=50J

(d) The answers are the same, i.e. the ldnetic energy
gained by the wheel = work done by the force.
There is no loss of energy due to friction. 4

7.13 ANGULAR MOMENTUM IN CASE OF
ROTATION ABOUT A FIXED AXIS

We have studied in section 7 .7, the angular
momentum of a system of particles. We already
know from there that the time rate of total
angular momentum of a system of particles
about a point is equal to the total external torque
on the system taken about the same point. When
the total external torque is zero, the total angular
momentum of the system is conserved.

We now wish to study the angular momentum
in the special case of rotation about a fixed axis.
The general expression for the total angular
momentum of the system of n particles is

N
L = Z r. X P. (7.2519)
i=1

We first consider the angular momentum of
a typical particle of the rotating rigid body. We
then sum up the contributions of individual
particles to get L of the whole body.

For a typical particle l = rXp. As seen in the
last section 1' = OP = 00 + CP [Fig 7. l7(b)]. With
