A woman starts from her home at 9.00 am, walks with a speed of 5 km h"1 on a
straight road up to her office 2.5 km away, stays at the office up to 5.00 pm, and
returns home by an auto with a speed of 25 km h_1. Choose suitable scales and
plot the x—t graph of her motion.

A drunkard walking in a narrow lane takes 5 steps forward and 3 steps backward,
followed again by 5 steps forward and 3 steps backward, and so on. Each step is 1
m long and requires 1 s. Plot the x—t graph of his motion. Determine graphically
and otherwise how long the drunkard takes to fall in a pit 13 m away from the
start.

A jet airplane travelling at the speed of 500 km h‘1 ejects its products of combustion
at the speed of 1500 km h‘1 relative to the jet plane. What is the speed of the
latter with respect to an observer on the ground ?

A car moving along a straight highway with speed of 126 km h‘1 is brought to a
stop within a distance of 200 m. What is the retardation of the car [assumed
uniform], and how long does it take for the car to stop ?

Two trains A and B of length 400 In each are moving on two parallel tracks with a
uniform speed of 72 km h—1 in the same direction, with A ahead of B. The driver of
B decides to overtake A and accelerates by 1 m s”. If after 50 s, the guard of B just
brushes past the driver of A, what was the original distance between them ?

On a two—lane road, car A is travelling with a speed of 36 km h—l. Two cars B and
C approach car A in opposite directions with a speed of 54 km h‘1 each. At a
certain instant, when the distance AB is equal to AC, both being 1 km, B decides
to overtake A before C does. What minimum acceleration of car B is required to
avoid an accident ?

Two towns A and B are connected by a regular bus service with a bus leaving in
either direction every Tminutes. A man cycling with a speed of 20 km h‘1 in the
direction A to B notices that a bus goes past him every 18 min in the direction of
his motion, and every 6 min in the opposite direction. What is the period Tof the
bus service and with what speed [assumed constant) do the buses ply on the
road?

A player throws a ball upwards with an initial speed of 29.4 m s‘l.

(a) What is the direction of acceleration during the upward motion of the ball ?

[b] What are the velocity and acceleration of the ball at the highest point of its
motion ?

(c) Choose the x = 0 m and t = 0 s to be the location and time of the ball at its
highest point, vertically downward direction to be the positive direction of
x—axis, and give the signs of position, velocity and acceleration of the ball
during its upward, and downward motion.

[d] To what height does the ball rise and after how long does the ball return to the
player’s hands ? [Take 9 = 9.8 m s*2 and neglect air resistance).
