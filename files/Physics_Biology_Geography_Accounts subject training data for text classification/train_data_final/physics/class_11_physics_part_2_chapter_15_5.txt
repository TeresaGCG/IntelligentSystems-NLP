15.3.2 Wavelength and Angular Wave
Number

The minimum distance between two points
having the same phase is called the wavelength
of the wave, usually denoted by 7L. For simplicity,
we can choose points of the same phase to be
crests or troughs. The wavelength is then the
distance between two consecutive crests or
troughs in a wave. Taking q) = O in Eq. (15.2),
the displacement at t= O is given by

y(x,0)= asinkx (15.5)

Since the sine function repeats its value after
every 27: change in angle,

sinkx = sin(kx + 2n7r) = sink (x + %)

That is the displacements at points x and at

2n7r
x+—
k

are the same, where n=1,2,3,... The least
distance between points with the same
displacement (at any given instant of time) is
obtained by taking n = 1. A, is then given by

27: 27:
xi:— k:—
k or ,1 (15.6)

k is the angular wave number or propagation
constant; its SI unit is radian per metre or

rad m‘1 *

15.3.3 Period. Angular Frequency and
Frequency

Fig. 15.7 shows again a sinusoidal plot. It
describes not the shape of the wave at a certain
instant but the displacement of an element (at
any fixed location) of the medium as a function
of time. We may for, simplicity, take Eq. (15.2)
with (1) = O and monitor the motion of the element
say at x = 0 . We then get

y(0, t) = a sin(—a)t)

= —a sin wt

<—T—>

Fig. 15.7 An element of a string at a ﬁxed location
oscillates in time with amplitude a and
period T, as the wave passes over it.

Now, the period of oscillation of the wave is the
time it takes for an element to complete one full
oscillation. That is

—a sin cat = —a sin w(t + T)
= —a sin(a)t + wT)

Since sine function repeats after every 271;,

27;

wT = 27: 01‘ a): T (15.7)

0) is called the angular frequency of the wave.

Its SI unit is rad 3'1. The frequency v is the
number of oscillations per second. Therefore,

1 a)

V : _ : _

T 27r
V is usually measured in hertz.
In the discussion above, reference has always
been made to a wave travelling along a string or
a transverse wave. In a longitudinal wave, the
displacement of an element of the medium is
parallel to the direction of propagation of the

wave. In Eq. (15.2), the displacement function
for a longitudinal wave is written as,

s(x, t) = a sin (kx— cot + (p) (15.9)

(15.8)

where s(x, t) is the displacement of an element
of the medium in the direction of propagation
of the wave at position xand time t. In Eq. (15.9),
a is the displacement amplitude; other
quantities have the same meaning as in case
of a transverse wave except that the
displacement function y (x, t) is to be replaced
by the function 5 (x, t).

* Here again, ‘radian’ could be dropped and the units could be written merely as m’l. Thus, k represents 27:
times the number of waves (or the total phase difference) that can be accommodated per unit length, with SI

units m‘1.
