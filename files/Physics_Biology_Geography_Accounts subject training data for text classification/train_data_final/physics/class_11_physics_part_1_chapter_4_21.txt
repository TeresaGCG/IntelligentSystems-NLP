(c) Ia—bl < |a|+|b|

[d] Ia—bl > IIaI—Ibll

When does the equality sign above apply?

4.7 Given a + b + c + d = 0, which of the following statements
are correct : Q

[a] a, b, c, and d must each be a null vector,

[b] The magnitude of [a + 0] equals the magnitude of

(b + d),

(c) The magnitude of a can never be greater than the
sum of the magnitudes of b, c, and d,

[d] b + c must lie in the plane of a and d if a and d are
not collinear, and in the line of a and d, if they are
collinear ?

4.8 Three girls skating on a circular ice ground of radius
200 m start from a point P on the edge of the ground
and reach a point Q diametrically opposite to Pfollowing

different paths as shown in Fig. 4.20. What is the P
magnitude of the displacement vector for each ? For Fig. 420
which girl is this equal to the actual length of

path skate ?

4.9 A cyclist starts from the centre 0 of a circular park of radius 1 km, reaches the edge P
of the park, then cycles along the circumference, and returns to the centre along QO
as shown in Fig. 4.2 1. If the round trip takes 10 min, what is the [a] net displacement,
(b) average velocity, and (c) average speed of the cyclist ?

4. 10 On an open ground, a motorist follows a track that turns to his left by an angle of 600
after every 500 m. Starting from a given turn, specify the displacement of the motorist
at the third, sixth and eighth turn. Compare the magnitude of the displacement with
the total path length covered by the motorist in each case.

4. 1 1 A passenger arriving in a new town wishes to go from the station to a hotel located
10 km away on a straight road from the station. A dishonest cabman takes him along
a circuitous path 23 km long and reaches the hotel in 28 min. What is [a] the average
speed of the taxi, (b) the magnitude of average velocity ? Are the two equal ?

4. 12 Rain is falling vertically with a speed of 30 m s‘l. A woman rides a bicycle with a speed
of 10 m s‘1 in the north to south direction. What is the direction in which she should
hold her umbrella ?

4.13 A man can swim with a speed of 4.0 km/h in still water. How long does he take to
cross a river 1.0 km wide if the river ﬂows steadily at 3.0 km/ h and he makes his
