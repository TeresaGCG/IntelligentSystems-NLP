EXAMPLE 2.10

 

Note that Ad is the volume of the region between the plates (where
electric ﬁeld alone exists). If we deﬁne energy density as energy stored
per unit volume of space, Eq (2.76) shows that

Energy density of electric ﬁeld,

u =(1/2)£0E2 (2.77)

Though we derived Eq. (2.77) for the case of a parallel plate capacitor,
the result on energy density of an electric ﬁeld is, in fact, very general and
holds true for electric ﬁeld due to any conﬁguration of charges.

Example 2.10 (a) A 900 pF capacitor is charged by 100 V battery
[Fig 2.3 1(a)]. How much electrostatic energy is stored by the capacitor?
(b) The capacitor is disconnected from the battery and connected to
another 900 pF capacitor [Fig 2.3 l(b)]. What is the electrostatic energy
stored by the system?

Solution
(a) The charge on the capacitor is

Q= CV= 900 x 10‘12FX 100v: 9 x 10%
The energy stored by the capacitor is

= (1/2) CV2 = (1/2) QV
= (1/2) x 9 x 10-8c x 100 V = 4.5 x 10‘6J

(b) In the steady situation, the two capacitors have their positive
plates at the same potential, and their negative plates at the
same potential. Let the common potential difference be V’. The
