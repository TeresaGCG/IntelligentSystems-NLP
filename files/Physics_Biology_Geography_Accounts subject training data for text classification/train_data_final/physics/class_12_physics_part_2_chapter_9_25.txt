FIGURE 9.25 Rainbow: (3) The sun rays incident on a water drop get
refracted twice and reﬂected internally by a drop: (b) Enlarged view of
internal reﬂection and refraction of a ray of light inside a drop forming
primary rainbow: and (c) secondary rainbow is formed by rays undergoing
internal reﬂection twice inside the drop.

When light rays undergoes two internal reﬂections inside a raindrop,
instead of one as in the primary rainbow, a secondary rainbow is formed
as shown in Fig. 925(0). It is due to four-step process. The intensity of
light is reduced at the second reﬂection and hence the secondary rainbow
is fainter than the primary rainbow. Further, the order of the colours is
reversed in it as is clear from Fig. 925(0).

9.7.2 Scattering of light

As sunlight travels through the earth’s atmosphere, it gets scattered
(changes its direction) by the atmospheric particles. Light of shorter
wavelengths is scattered much more than light of longer wavelengths.
(The amount of scattering is inversely proportional to the fourth power
of the wavelength. This is known as Rayleigh scattering). Hence, the bluish
colour predominates in a clear sky, since blue has a shorter wave-
length than red and is scattered much more strongly. In fact, violet
gets scattered even more than blue, having a shorter wavelength.
But since our eyes are more sensitive to blue than violet, we see the
sky blue.

Large particles like dust and water droplets present in the atmosphere
behave differently. The relevant quantity here is the relative size of the
wavelength of light 2., and the scatterer (of typical size, say, a). For a << 1,
one has Rayleigh scattering which is proportional to 1/14. For a >> A,
i.e., large scattering objects (for example, raindrops, large dust or ice
particles) this is not true; all wavelengths are scattered nearly equally.
Thus, clouds which have droplets of water with a >> A are generally white.
