MOTION IN A STRAIGHT LINE

is equal to the average speed. This is not always
the case, as you will see in the following example.

> Example 3.1 A car is moving along a
straight line. say OP in Fig. 3.1. It moves
from O to P in 18 s and returns from P to Q
in 6.0 s. What are the average velocity

and average speed of the car in going (a)
from O to P ? and (b) from O to P and back
to Q ‘?

Answer (a)

Displacement
Average velocity = —

Time interval

— +
v = ﬂ = + 20 m s’1
18 s
Path length
Average speed 2 —
Time interval
= 360 m

= 20 m s’1

 

185

Thus, in this case the average speed is equal to
the magnitude of the average velocity.
(b) In this case,

, Displacement +240 m
Average veloaty = — = ——
Time interval (18 + 6.0) s

=+ 10 m s‘1
Average speed = Path-length = OP + PQ
Time interval At
=(360+120) n1= 20 m s'1
24 s

Thus, in this case the average speed is not equal
to the magnitude of the average velocity. This
happens because the motion here involves
change in direction so that the path length is
greater than the magnitude of displacement.
This shows that speed is, in general, greater
than the magnitude of the velocity. 4

If the car in Example 3.1 moves from O to P

and comes back to O in the same time interval,
average speed is 20 m/s but the average velocity
is zero !

 

3.4 INSTANTANEOUS VELOCITY AND SPEED

The average velocity tells us how fast an object
has been moving over a given time interval but
does not tell us how fast it moves at different
instants of time during that interval. For this,
we define instantaneous velocity or simply
velocity v at an instant t.

The velocity at an instant is defined as the
limit of the average velocity as the time interval
Atbecomes infinitesimally small. In other words,

. Ax
v = lim — (3.3a)
At —> 0 At
: d_X (3.313)
dt
where the symbol A1110 stands for the operation

of taking limit as At—>O of the quantity on its
right. In the language of calculus, the quantity
on the right hand side of Eq. (3.3a) is the
differential coefficient of xwith respect to tand

dx

is denoted by E (see Appendix 3.1). It is the

rate of change of position with respect to time,

at that instant.

We can use Eq. (3.3a) for obtaining the value
of velocity at an instant either graphically or
numerically. Suppose that we want to obtain
graphically the value of velocity at time t = 4 s
(point P) for the motion of the car represented
in Fig. 3.3. The figure has been redrawn in
Fig. 3.6 choosing different scales to facilitate the
