Fig. 1 5.9 Two pulses having equal and opposite
displacements moving in opposite
directions. The overlapping pulses add up
to zero displacement in curve (c).

According to this principle, each pulse moves
as if others are not present. The constituents of
the medium, therefore, suffer displacments due
to both and since the displacements can be
positive and negative, the net displacement is
an algebraic sum of the two. Fig. 15.9 gives
graphs of the wave shape at different times. Note
the dramatic effect in the graph (c); the
displacements due to the two pulses have exactly
cancelled each other and there is zero
displacement throughout.

To put the principle of superposition
mathematically, let y1 (x, t) and y2 (x, t) be the
displacements due to two wave disturbances in
the medium. If the waves arrive in a region
simultaneously, and therefore, overlap, the net
displacement y (x, t) is given by

y (x, t) = y,(x, t) + y2(x, t) (15.25)

If we have two or more waves moving in the
medium the resultant waveform is the sum of
wave functions of individual waves. That is, if
the wave functions of the moving waves are

y1=f,(X—vt),
yz =‘j;(x—Ut),
y =fn(x—vt)

then the wave function describing the
disturbance in the medium is

y =f1(X— vt)+f2(x— vt)+ ...+fn(x— vt)

The principle of superposition is basic to the
phenomenon of interference.

For simplicity, consider two harmonic
travelling waves on a stretched string, both with
the same to (angular frequency) and k (wave
number), and, therefore, the same wavelength
1. Their wave speed will be identical. Let us
further assume that their amplitudes are equal
and they are both travelling in the positive
direction of x-aXis. The waves only differ in their
initial phase. According to Eq. (15.2), the two
waves are described by the functions:

y1(x, t) = a sin (kx— wt) (15.27)

and y2(x, t) = a sin (kx— wt + (1)) (15.28)

The net displacement is then, by the principle
of superposition, given by

y (x, t) = asin (kx—wt) +asin (kx—wt+q))

where we have used the familiar trignometric

Eq. (15.3 1) is also a harmonic travelling wave in
the positive direction of x-axis, with the same
frequency and wavelength. However, its initial

phase angle is E . The significant thing is that

its amplitude is a function of the phase difference
¢ between the constituent two waves:

For (1) = 0, when the waves are in phase,
y(x,t)=2a sin(kx—a)t) (15.33)

i.e., the resultant wave has amplitude 2a, the

largest possible value for A. For ¢=7£, the
