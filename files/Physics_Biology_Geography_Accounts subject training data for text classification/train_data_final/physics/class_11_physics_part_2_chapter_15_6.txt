Example 15.2 A wave travelling along a
string is described by.

y(x. t) = 0.005 sin (80.0 x— 3.0 t).

in which the numerical constants are in
SI units (0.005 m. 80.0 rad m". and

3.0 rad s“). Calculate (a) the amplitude.
(b) the wavelength. and (c) the period and
frequency of the wave. Also. calculate the
displacement y of the wave at a distance
x= 30.0 cm and time t= 20 s ‘?

Answer On comparing this displacement
equation with Eq. (15.2),

y (x, t) = asin (kx— wt),

we find

(a) the amplitude of the wave is 0.005 m = 5 mm.

(b) the angular wave number k and angular
frequency a) are

k = 80.0 m‘1 and a) = 3.0 S‘1

We, then, relate the wavelength /’L to k through
Eq. (15.6),
/'L = 27c/ k

_ 27;
80.0 m—1
= 7.85 cm

(c) Now, we relate Tto a) by the relation
T = 21c/ 60

_ 27:
3.0 s_1
= 2.09 s

 

and frequency, v = 1 / T = 0.48 Hz

The displacement y at x = 30.0 cm and
time t = 20 s is given by

y = (0.005 m) Sin (80.0 X 0.3 — 3.0 X 20)

= (0.005 m) sin (—36 + 127:)
= (0.005 m) sin (1.699)
= (0.005 m) sin (97°) 2 5 mm 4

15.4 THE SPEED OF A TRAVELLING WAVE

To determine the speed of propagation of a
travelling wave, we can fix our attention on any
particular point on the wave (characterised by
some value of the phase) and see how that point
moves in time. It is convenient to look at the

 

motion of the crest of the wave. Fig. 15.8 gives
the shape of the wave at two instants of time,
which differ by a small time internal At. The
entire wave pattern is seen to shift to the right
(positive direction of x—aXis) by a distance Ax. In
particular, the crest shown by a clot (0) moves a

distance Ax in time At. The speed of the wave is
then Ax/At. We can put the clot (c) on a point
with any other phase. It will move with the same
speed v (otherwise the wave pattern will not
remain fixed). The motion of a fixed phase point
on the wave is given by

kx — (at = constant (15.10)

Thus, as time t changes, the position x of the
fixed phase point must change so that the phase
remains constant. Thus,

kx — cat = k(x+Ax) — w(t+A t)
or k Ax — coAt =0
Taking Ax, Atvanishingly small, this gives

Eq. (15.12), a general relation for all
progressive waves, shows that in the time
required for one full oscillation by any
constituent of the medium, the wave pattern
travels a distance equal to the wavelength of the
wave. It should be noted that the speed of a
mechanical wave is determined by the inertial
