When the final image is formed at inﬁnity, the angular magniﬁcation
due to the eyepiece [Eq. (9.42)] is

m. = (Dug) [9.44th

Thus, the total magnification [(according to Eq. (9.33)], when the
image is formed at infinity, is

m=mm = i 2
o e f0 L (9.45)

Clearly, to achieve a large magnification of a small object (hence the
name microscope), the objective and eyepiece should have small focal
lengths. In practice, it is difﬁcult to make the focal length much smaller
than 1 cm. Also large lenses are required to make L large.

For example, with an objective with fo = 1.0 cm, and an eyepiece with
focal length fe = 2.0 cm, and a tube length of 20 cm, the magnification is

rummage

= a x g = 250
1 2
Various other factors such as illumination of the object, contribute to
the quality and visibility of the image. In modern microscopes, multi-
component lenses are used for both the objective and the eyepiece to
improve image quality by minimising various optical aberrations (defects)
in lenses.

9.8.2 Telescope

The telescope is used to provide angular magnification of distant objects
(Fig. 9.29). It also has an objective and an eyepiece. But here, the objective
has a large focal length and a much larger aperture than the eyepiece.
Light from a distant object enters the objective and a real image is formed
in the tube at its second focal point. The eyepiece magniﬁes this image
producing a final inverted image. The magnifying power m is the ratio of
the angle [3 subtended at the eye by the ﬁnal image to the angle a which
the‘object subtends at the lens or the eye. Hence

m:_:_,_:_ (9.46)

In this case, the length of the telescope tube is fo +fe.

Terrestrial telescopes have, in addition, a pair of inverting lenses to
make the ﬁnal image erect. Refracting telescopes can be used both for
terrestrial and astronomical observations. For example, consider
a telescope whose objective has a focal length of 100 cm and the eyepiece
a focal length of 1 cm. The magnifying power of this telescope is
m = 100/1 = 100.
