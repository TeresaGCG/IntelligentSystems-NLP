3. 16 POTENTIOMETER

This is a versatile instrument. It is basically a long piece of uniform wire,
sometimes a few meters in length across which a standard cell (B) is
connected. In actual design, the wire is sometimes cut in several pieces
placed side by side and connected at the ends by thick metal strip.
(Fig. 3.28). In the figure, the wires run from A to C. The small vertical
portions are the thick metal strips connecting the various sections of

the wire.

A current I ﬂows through the wire which can be varied by a variable
resistance (rheostat, R) in the circuit. Since the wire is uniform, the
potential difference between A and any point at a distance lfrom A is

8(l)=¢l

(3.89)

where q) is the potential drop per unit length.

Figure 3.28 (a) shows an application of the potentiometer to compare
the emf of two cells of emf £1 and £2 . The points marked 1, 2, 3 form a two
way key. Consider first a position of the key where 1 and 3 are connected

so that the galvanometer is connected to £1. The jockey
is moved along the wire till at a point N1, at a distance 11
from A, there is no deﬂection in the galvanometer. We
can apply Kirchhoffs loop rule to the closed loop

AN1G31A and get,

¢ll+O—£1=O (3.90)
Similarly, if another emf 82 is balanced against 12 (AN 2)

This simple mechanism thus allows one to compare
the emf s of any two sources (81,82). In practice one of the
cells is chosen as a standard cell whose emf is known to
a high degree of accuracy. The emf of the other cell is
then easily calculated from Eq. (3.92).

We can also use a potentiometer to measure internal
resistance of a cell [Fig. 3.28 (b)]. For this the cell (emf 8)
whose internal resistance (r) is to be determined is
connected across a resistance box through a key K2, as
shown in the figure. With key K2 open, balance is
obtained at length 11 (AN 1). Then,

8 = 45 11 [3.93(a)1

When key K2 is closed, the cell sends a current (I)
through the resistance box (R). If V is the terminal
potential difference of the cell and balance is obtained at
length 12(AN2),

V: ¢ 12 [3.93m]
