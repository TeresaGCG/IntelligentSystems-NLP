Albert Einstein (1879 -
1955) Einstein, one of the
greatest physicists of all
time, was born in Ulm,
Germany. In 1905, he
published three path-
breaking papers. In the
first paper, he introduced
the notion of light quanta
(now called photons) and
used it to explain the
features of photoelectric
effect. In the second paper,
he developed a theory of
Brownian motion,
confirmed experimentally a
few years later and provided
a convincing evidence of
the atomic picture of matter.
The third paper gave birth
to the special theory of
relativity. In 1916, he
published the general
theory of relativity. Some of
Einstein’s most significant
later contributions are: the
notion of stimulated
emission introduced in an
alternative derivation of
Planck’s blackbody
radiation law, static model
of the universe which
started modern cosmology,
quantum statistics of a gas
of massive bosons, and a
critical analysis of the
foundations of quantum
mechanics. In 1921, he was
awarded the Nobel Prize in
physics for his contribution
to theoretical physics and
the photoelectric effect.

 

 

 

has energy hv, where h is Planck’s constant and v the
frequency of light. In photoelectric effect, an electron
absorbs a quantum of energy (hv) of radiation. If this
quantum of energy absorbed exceeds the minimum
energy needed for the electron to escape from the metal
surface (work function $0), the electron is emitted with
maximum kinetic energy

Kmax=hv—¢O (11.2)

More tightly bound electrons will emerge with kinetic
energies less than the maximum value. Note that the
intensity of light of a given frequency is determined by
the number of photons incident per second. Increasing
the intensitywill increase the number of emitted electrons
per second. However, the maximum kinetic energy of the
emitted photoelectrons is determined by the energy of each
photon.

Equation (1 1.2) is known as Einstein’s photoelectric
equation. We now see how this equation accounts in a
simple and elegant manner all the observations on
photoelectric effect given at the end of sub-section 1 1.4.3.
0 According to Eq. (1 1.2), Kmax depends linearly on v,

and is independent of intensity of radiation, in

agreement with observation. This has happened
because in Einstein’s picture, photoelectric effect arises
from the absorption of a single quantum of radiation
by a single electron. The intensity of radiation (that is
proportional to the number of energy quanta per unit
area per unit time) is irrelevant to this basic process.

0 Since Kmax must be non-negative, Eq. (1 1.2 ) implies
that photoelectric emission is possible only if

h v > ()0

or v > v0 , where

‘ h
Equation (11.3) shows that the greater the work
function ()0, the higher the minimum or threshold
frequency v0 needed to emit photoelectrons. Thus,
there exists a threshold frequency v0 (= 9150/ h) for the
metal surface, below which no photoelectric emission
is possible, no matter how intense the incident
radiation may be or how long it falls on the surface.

0 In this picture, intensity of radiation as noted above,
is proportional to the number of energy quanta per
unit area per unit time. The greater the number of
energy quanta available, the greater is the number of
electrons absorbing the energy quanta and greater,
therefore, is the number of electrons coming out of
the metal (for v > v0). This explains why, for v > v0,
photoelectric current is proportional to intensity.
