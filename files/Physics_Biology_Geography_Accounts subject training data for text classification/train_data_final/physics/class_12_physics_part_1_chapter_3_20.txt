VAB = 2 A x 2 s2 = 4 V

The voltage drop across BC is
VBC=2AX 1 Q=2V

Finally, the voltage drop across CD is

VCD=12QXIS=12QX[§]A=8V.

This can alternately be obtained by multiplying total current
between C and D by the equivalent resistance between C and D,
that is,

VCD=2AX4Q=8V

Note that the total voltage drop across AD is 4 V + 2 V + 8 V = 14 V.
Thus, the terminal voltage of the battery is 14 V, while its emf is 16 V.
The loss of the voltage (= 2 V) is accounted for by the internal resistance

3. 12 CELLS IN SERIES AND IN PARALLEL

Like resistors, cells can be combined together in an electric circuit. And
like resistors, one can, for calculating currents and voltages in a circuit,
replace a combination of cells by an equivalent cell.

FIGURE 3.20 Two cells of emfs £1 and 82 in the sen’es. rl. r2 are their
internal resistances. For connections across A and C. the combination

can be considered as one cell of emf Em and an internal resistance rm.

Consider ﬁrst two cells in series (Fig. 3.20), where one terminal of the
two cells is joined together leaving the other terminal in either cell free.
81, 82 are the emfs of the two cells and r1, r2 their internal resistances,
respectively.

Let V(A), V(B), V(C) be the potentials at points A, B and C shown in
Fig. 3.20. Then V(A) — V(B) is the potential difference between the positive
and negative terminals of the ﬁrst cell. We have already calculated it in
Eq. (3.57) and hence,

VAB E V(A)— V(B): £1 — Ir1 (3.60)
Similarly,
VBCEV(B)—V(C)=.92—Ir2 (3.61)

Hence, the potential difference between the terminals A and C of the
combination is

VAC 5 V(A)— V(C): V(A) — V(B) + V(B)— V(C)

=(.91+.92)—I(r1 +r2) (3.62)
