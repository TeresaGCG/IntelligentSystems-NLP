We thus see that a very simple picture of electrical conduction
reproduces Ohm’s law. We have, of course, made assumptions that T
and n are constants, independent of E. We shall, in the next section,
discuss the limitations of Ohm’s law.

Example 3.1 (a) Estimate the average drift speed of conduction
electrons in a copper wire of cross-sectional area 1.0 X 10‘7 m2 carrying
a current of 1.5 A. Assume that each copper atom contributes roughly
one conduction electron. The density of copper is 9.0 X 103 kg/m3,
and its atomic mass is 63.5 u. (b) Compare the drift speed obtained
above with, (i) thermal speeds of copper atoms at ordinary
temperatures, (ii) speed of propagation of electric field along the
conductor which causes the drift motion.

Solution

(a)

(b)

The direction of drift velocity of conduction electrons is opposite
to the electric field direction, i.e., electrons drift in the direction
of increasing potential. The drift speed vd is given by Eq. (3.18)
vd = (I/neA)

Now, e = 1.6 x 10‘19 c, A = 1.0 x 10‘7m2, I = 1.5 A. The density of
conduction electrons, n is equal to the number of atoms per cubic
metre (assuming one conduction electron per Cu atom as is
reasonable from its valence electron count of one). A cubic metre
of copper has a mass of 9.0 X 103 kg. Since 6.0 X 1023 copper
atoms have a mass of 63.5 g,

6.0 x 1023
n = —
63.5

= 8.5 x 1028 m"3

x 9.0 x 106

which gives,

1.5
U =

= 1.1 X 10‘3ms‘1 = 1.1 mm s‘1

(i) At a temperature T, the thermal speed“ of a copper atom of
mass M is obtained from [<(1/2) Mv2 > = (3/2) kBT) and is thus

typically of the order of \lkBT/M , where (:5 is the Boltzmann

constant. For copper at 300 K, this is about 2 X 102 m/s. This
figure indicates the random vibrational speeds of copper atoms
in a conductor. Note that the drift speed of electrons is much
smaller, about 10‘5 times the typical thermal speed at ordinary
temperatures.

(ii) An electric field travelling along the conductor has a speed of
an electromagnetic wave, namely equal to 3.0 X 108 m s‘1
(You will learn about this in Chapter 8). The drift speed is, in

comparison, extremely small; smaller by a factor of 10—11.
