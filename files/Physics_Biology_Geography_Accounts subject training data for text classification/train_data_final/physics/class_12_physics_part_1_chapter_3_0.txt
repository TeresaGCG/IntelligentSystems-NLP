ELECTRICITY

3. 1 INTRODUCTION

In Chapter 1, all charges whether free or bound, were considered to be at
rest. Charges in motion constitute an electric current. Such currents occur
naturally in many situations. Lightning is one such phenomenon in
which charges ﬂow from the clouds to the earth through the atmosphere,
sometimes with disastrous results. The ﬂow of charges in lightning is not
steady, but in our everyday life we see many devices where charges ﬂow
in a steady manner, like water ﬂowing smoothly in a river. A torch and a
cell-driven clock are examples of such devices. In the present chapter, we
shall study some of the basic laws concerning steady electric currents.

3.2 ELECTRIC CURRENT

Imagine a small area held normal to the direction of ﬂow of charges. Both
the positive and the negative charges may ﬂow forward and backward
across the area. In a given time interval t, let q+ be the net amount (i.e.,
forward minus backward) of positive charge that ﬂows in the forward
direction across the area. Similarly, let q_ be the net amount of negative
charge ﬂowing across the area in the forward direction. The net amount
of charge ﬂowing across the area in the forward direction in the time
interval t, then, is q = q+— q_. This is proportional to tfor steady current
