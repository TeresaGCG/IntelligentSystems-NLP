the globe. Why then does the atmosphere not discharge itself
completely in due course and become electrically neutral? In
other words, what keeps the atmosphere charged?

What are the forms of energy into which the electrical energy
of the atmosphere is dissipated during a lightning?

(Hint: The earth has an electric field of about 100 Vm’1 at its
surface in the downward direction, corresponding to a surface
charge density = —10’9 C m’2. Due to the slight conductivity of
the atmosphere up to about 50 km (beyond which it is good
conductor), about + 1800 C is pumped every second into the
earth as a whole. The earth, however, does not get discharged
since thunderstorms and lightning occurring continually all

over the globe pump an equal amount of negative charge on
the earth.)
