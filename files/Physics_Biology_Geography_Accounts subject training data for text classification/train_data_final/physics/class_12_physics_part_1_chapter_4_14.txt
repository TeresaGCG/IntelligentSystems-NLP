The summation of elements dlover the loop yields 27CR, the
circumference of the loop. Thus, the magnetic ﬁeld at P due to entire
circular loop is

.UOIR2

B=Bxi=W (4.15)

As a special case of the above result, we may obtain the field at the centre
of the loop. Here x = O, and we obtain,

BO =._1 (4.16)

The magnetic ﬁeld lines due to a circular wire form closed loops and
are shown in Fig. 4.12. The direction of the magnetic ﬁeld is given by
(another) right-hand thumb rule stated below:

Curl the palm of your right hand around the circular wire with the
ﬁngers pointing in the direction of the current. The right-hand thumb
gives the direction of the magnetic field.

 

FIGURE 4.12 The magnetic field lines for a current loop. The direction of

the field is given by the right—hand thumb rule described in the text. The

upper side of the loop may be thought of as the north pole and the lower
side as the south pole of a magnet.

Example 4.6 A straight wire carrying a current of 12 A is bent into a
semi-circular arc of radius 2.0 cm as shown in Fig. 4.13(a). Consider
the magnetic field B at the centre of the are. (a) What is the magnetic
field due to the straight segments? (b) In what way the contribution
to B from the semicircle differs from that of a circular 100p and in
what way does it resemble? (c) Would your answer be different if the
wire were bent into a semi-circular arc of the same radius but in the
opposite way as shown in Fig. 4.13(b)?
