EXAMPLE 4.8

Now the current enclosed 18 is not I, but is less than this value.
Since the current distribution is uniform, the current enclosed is,

FIGURE 4. 16

Figure (4.16) shows a plot of the magnitude of B with distance r
from the centre of the wire. The direction of the ﬁeld is tangential to
the respective circular loop (1 or 2) and given by the right-hand
rule described earlier in this section.

This example possesses the required symmetry so that Ampere’s
law can be applied readily.

It should be noted that while Ampere’s circuital law holds for any
loop, it may not always facilitate an evaluation of the magnetic field in
every case. For example, for the case of the circular loop discussed in
Section 4.6, it cannot be applied to extract the simple expression
B = ,uOI/ZR [Eq. (4.16)] for the field at the centre of the loop. However,
there exists a large number of situations of high symmetry where the law
can be conveniently applied. We shall use it in the next section to calculate
the magnetic field produced by two commonly used and very useful
magnetic systems: the solenoid and the toroid.

4.8 THE SOLENOID AND THE TOROID

The solenoid and the toroid are two pieces of equipment which generate
magnetic fields. The television uses the solenoid to generate magnetic
fields needed. The synchrotron uses a combination of both to generate
the high magnetic fields required. In both, solenoid and toroid, we come
across a situation of high symmetry where Ampere’s law can be
conveniently applied.
