Example 4.9 A solenoid of length 0.5 m has a radius of 1 cm and is
made up of 500 turns. It carries a current of 5 A. What is the
magnitude of the magnetic field inside the solenoid?

Solution The number of turns per unit length is,

_ 500

n —=1000 turns/m
0.5

B=y0nI

EXAMPLE 4.9

The length l= 0.5 m and radius r = 0.01 m. Thus, l/a = 50 i.e., I» a.
Hence, we can use the long solenoid formula, namely, Eq. (4.20)

= 6.28 x 10‘3 T

THE AMPERE

We have learnt that there exists a magnetic ﬁeld due to a conductor
carrying a current which obeys the Biot-Savart law. Further, we have

learnt that an external magnetic ﬁeld will exert a force on
a current-carrying conductor. This follows from the
Lorentz force formula. Thus, it is logical to expect that
two current-carrying conductors placed near each other
will exert (magnetic) forces on each other. In the period
1820-25, Ampere studied the nature of this magnetic
force and its dependence on the magnitude of the current,
on the shape and size of the conductors, as well as, the
distances between the conductors. In this section, we
shall take the simple example of two parallel current-
carrying conductors, which will perhaps help us to
appreciate Ampere’s painstaking work.

Figure 4.20 shows two long parallel conductors a
and b separated by a distance d and carrying (parallel)
currents Ia and 1b, respectively. The conductor ‘a’
produces, the same magnetic ﬁeld Ba at all points along
the conductor ‘b’. The right-hand rule tells us that the
direction of this ﬁeld is downwards (when the conductors

are placed horizontally). Its magnitude is given by Eq. [4.19(a)] or from
Ampere’s circuital law,

Ba : #010.

The conductor ‘b’ carrying a current Ib will experience a sideways
force due to the ﬁeld Ba. The direction of this force is towards the
conductor ‘a’ (Verify this). We label this force as F a, the force on a
segment L of ‘b’ due to ‘a’. The magnitude of this force is given by
