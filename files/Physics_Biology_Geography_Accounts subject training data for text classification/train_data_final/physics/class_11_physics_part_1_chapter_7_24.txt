Theorem of perpendicular axes the theorem. It states that the moment of

_ _ _ _ _ inertia of a planar body (lamina) about an axis
T hlS theorem is applicable to bodies Wthh are Perpendicular to its plane is equal to the sum

planar. In practice this means the theorem of its moments of inertia about two
applies to ﬂat bodies whose thickness is very Perpendicular axes concurrent with

small compared to their other dimensions (e.g. perpendicular axis and lying in the plane of
length, breadth or radius). Fig. 7 .29 illustrates the body.
