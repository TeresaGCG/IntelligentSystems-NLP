MOTION IN A STRAIGHT LINE

Example 3.2 The position of an object
moving along x—axis is given by x = a + bt2
where a = 8.5 m. b = 2.5 m 8’2 and t is

measured in seconds. What is its velocity at
t = O s and t = 2.0 5. What is the average
velocity between t = 2.0 s and t = 4.0 s ?

velocity is

From Fig. 3.7, we note that during the period
t= 10 s to 18 s the velocity is constant. Between
period t = 18 s to t = 20 s, it is uniformly
decreasing and during the period t= 0 s to t
= 10 s, it is increasing. Note that for uniform
motion, velocity is the same as the average
velocity at all instants.

Instantaneous speed or simply speed is the
magnitude of velocity. For example, a velocity of
+ 24.0 m S'1 and a velocity of— 24.0 m S'1 — both
have an associated speed of 24.0 m s4. It should
be noted that though average speed over a finite
interval of time is greater or equal to the
magnitude of the average velocity,
instantaneous speed at an instant is equal to
the magnitude of the instantaneous velocity at
that instant. Why so ?

3.5 ACCELERATION

The velocity of an object, in general, changes
during its course of motion. How to describe this
change? Should it be described as the rate of
change in velocity with distance or with time ?
This was a problem even in Galileo’s time. It was
first thought that this change could be described
by the rate of change of velocity with distance.
But, through his studies of motion of freely falling
objects and motion of objects on an inclined
plane, Galileo concluded that the rate of change
of velocity with time is a constant of motion for
all objects in free fall. On the other hand, the
change in velocity with distance is not constant
— it decreases with the increasing distance of fall.

Average velocity =

= 6.0><b

This led to the concept of acceleration as the rate
of change of velocity with time.

The average acceleration 6 over a time

interval is defined as the change of velocity
divided by the time interval :

where v2 and D1 are the instantaneous velocities
or simply velocities at time t2 and t1 . It is the
average change of velocity per unit time. The SI
unit of acceleration is m S'2 .

On a plot of velocity versus time, the average
acceleration is the slope of the straight line
connecting the points corresponding to (v2, t2)
and (v1, t1). The average acceleration

different time intervals 0 s - 10 s, 10 s — 18 s,

Instantaneous acceleration is defined in the same

The acceleration at an instant is the slope of
the tangent to the v—t curve at that instant. For
the v—t curve shown in Fig. 3.7, we can obtain
acceleration at every instant of time. The

resulting a— tcurve is shown in Fig. 3.8. We see
