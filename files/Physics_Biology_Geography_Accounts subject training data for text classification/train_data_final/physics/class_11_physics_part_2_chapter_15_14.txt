and so on. We can label the various
harmonics by the symbol vn ( n = 1,
2, ...).

ig. 15. 13 shows the first six
harmonics of a stretched string
fixed at either end. A string need not
vibrate in one of these modes only.
Generally, the vibration of a string
will be a superposition of different
modes; some modes may be more
strongly excited and some less.

Let us next consider normal
modes of oscillation of an air column
with one end closed and the other
open. A glass tube partially filled
with water illustrates this system.
The end in contact with water is a
node, while the open end is an
antinode. At the node the pressure
changes are the largest, while the
displacement is minimum (zero). At
the open end - the antinode, it is
just the other way - least pressure

are odd harmonics, i.e., odd multiples of the

fundamental frequency : 3:, 5L, etc.

Fig. 15.14 shows the first six odd harmonics of

air column with one end closed and the other
open. For a pipe open at both ends, each end is
an antinode. It is then easily seen that an open
air column at both ends generates all harmonics
(See Fig. 15.15).

The systems above, strings and air columns,
can also undergo forced oscillations (Chapter
14). If the external frequency is close to one of
the natural frequencies, the system shows
resonance.
