Toricelli’s barometer used mercury. Pascal duplicated it using French wine of density
984 kg m'3. Determine the height of the wine column for normal atmospheric
pressure.

A vertical off—shore structure is built to withstand a maximum stress of 109 Pa. Is
the structure suitable for putting up on top of an oil well in the ocean ? Take the
depth of the ocean to be roughly 3 km, and ignore ocean currents.

A hydraulic automobile lift is designed to lift cars with a maximum mass of 3000
kg. The area of cross—section of the piston carrying the load is 425 cm2. What
maximum pressure would the smaller piston have to bear ?

A U-tube contains water and methylated spirit separated by mercury. The mercury
columns in the two arms are in level with 10.0 cm of water in one arm and 12.5 cm
of spirit in the other. What is the specific gravity of spirit ?

In the previous problem, if 15.0 cm of water and spirit each are further poured into
the respective arms of the tube, what is the difference in the levels of mercury in
the two arms ? (Specific gravity of mercury = 13.6)

Can Bernoulli's equation be used to describe the ﬂow of water through a rapid in a
river ? Explain.

Does it matter if one uses gauge instead of absolute pressures in applying Bernoulli’s
equation ? Explain.

Glycerine ﬂows steadily through a horizontal tube of length 1.5 m and radius 1.0
cm. If the amount of glycerine collected per second at one end is 4.0 x 10'3 kg s'l,
what is the pressure difference between the two ends of the tube ? [Density of glycerine
= 1 .3 x 103 kg m"3 and viscosity of glycerine = 0.83 Pa s]. [You may also like to check
if the assumption of laminar ﬂow in the tube is correct].

In a test experiment on a model aeroplane in a wind tunnel, the ﬂow speeds on the
upper and lower surfaces of the wing are 70 m s'land 63 m s‘1 respectively. What is
the lift on the wing if its area is 2.5 m2 ? Take the density of air to be 1.3 kg m's.

Figures 10.23[a] and (b) refer to the steady ﬂow of a (non—viscous) liquid. Which of
the two figures is incorrect ? Why ?

The cylindrical tube of a spray pump has a cross—section of 8.0 cm2 one end of
which has 40 fine holes each of diameter 1.0 mm. If the liquid ﬂow inside the tube
is 1.5 m min—1, what is the speed of ejection of the liquid through the holes ?

A U—shaped wire is dipped in a soap solution, and removed. The thin soap film
formed between the wire and the light slider supports a weight of 1.5 x 10'2 N
[which includes the small weight of the slider]. The length of the slider is 30 cm.
What is the surface tension of the film ?

Figure 10.24 (a) shows a thin liquid film supporting a small weight = 4.5 x 10'2 N.
What is the weight supported by a film of the same liquid at the same temperature
in Fig. (b) and [c] ? Explain your answer physically.
