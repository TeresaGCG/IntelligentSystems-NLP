Then, the velocity of the block at x = 5 cm is
= 0.1 X 7.07 X 0.866 m S—1
= 0.61 m s—1

Hence the K.E. of the block,

=lmv2
2

= 1/2[1kg X (0.6123 m S'1)2]
= 0.19 J
The P.E. of the block,

= l k x2
2
= 1/2(50 N m‘1 X 0.05 m X 0.05 m)
= 0.0625 J
The total energy of the block at x = 5 cm,

= K.E. + RE.
= 0.25J

we also know that at maximum displacement,
K.E. is zero and hence the total energy of the
system is equal to the RE. Therefore, the total
energy of the system,

=1/2(50Nm'1X 0.1mX0.1m)

= 0.25 J
which is same as the sum of the two energies at
a displacement of 5 cm. This is in conformity
with the principle of conservation of energy. 4

14.8 SOME SYSTEMS EXECUTING SIMPLE
HARMONIC MOTION

There are no physical examples of absolutely
pure simple harmonic motion. In practice we
come across systems that execute simple
harmonic motion approximately under certain
conditions. In the subsequent part of this
section, we discuss the motion executed by some
such systems.

14.8.1 Oscillations due to a Spring

The simplest observable example of simple
harmonic motion is the small oscillations of a
block of mass m fixed to a spring, which in turn
is fixed to a rigid wall as shown in Fig. 14.17.
The block is placed on a frictionless horizontal
surface. If the block is pulled on one side and is
released, it then executes a to and fro motion
about the mean position. Let x = 0, indicate the
position of the centre of the block when the

spring is in equilibrium. The positions marked
as —A and +A indicate the maximum
displacements to the left and the right of the
mean position. We have already learnt that
springs have special properties, which were first
discovered by the English physicist Robert
Hooke. He had shown that such a system when
deformed, is subject to a restoring force, the
magnitude of which is proportional to the
deformation or the displacement and acts in
opposite direction. This is known as Hooke’s
law (Chapter 9). It holds good for displacements
small in comparison to the length of the spring.
At any time t, if the displacement of the block
from its mean position is x, the restoring force F
acting on the block is,

F(x) =—kx (14.19)

The constant of proportionality, k, is called
the spring constant, its value is governed by the
elastic properties of the spring. A stiff spring has
large k and a soft spring has small k. Equation
(14.19) is same as the force law for SHM and
therefore the system executes a simple harmonic
motion. From Eq. (14.14) we have,

and the period, T, of the oscillator is given by,

Stiff springs have high value of k (spring
constant). A block of small mass m attached to
a stiff spring will have, according to Eq. (14.20),
large oscillation frequency, as expected
physically.
