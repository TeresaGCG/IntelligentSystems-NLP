UNITS AND MEASUREMENT l7

international usage in scientific, technical,

industrial and commercial work. Because SI r (15
units used decimal system, conversions within

the system are quite simple and convenient. We 0 A

shall follow the SI units in this book. d .
0 = ds/ r radian
In SI, there are seven base units as given in

Table 2.1. Besides the seven base units, there (a)
are two more units that are defined for (a) plane r

angle d0 as the ratio of length of arc ds to the 1A

radius r and (b) solid angle d9 as the ratio of O ‘7

the intercepted area dA of the spherical surface,

described about the apex O as the centre, to

 

the square of its radius r, as shown in Fig. 2.1(a) d g = d A /,-Z steradian

and (b) respectively. The unit for plane angle is

radian with the symbol rad and the unit for the 03)

solid angle is steradian with the symbol sr. Both Fig. 2- 1 Description Of (a) plane angle (19 and
these are dimensionless quantities. (b) solid angle d9.

Length 111

metre The metre is the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum
during a time interval of 1 / 299,792,458 of a second. (1983)

Mass kilogram kg The kilogram is equal to the mass of the intemational prototype
of the kilogram (a platinum-iridium alloy cylinder) kept at
international Bureau of Weights and Measures, at Sevres, near
Paris, France. (1889]

Time second s The second is the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the
radiation corresponding to the transition between the two
hyperﬁne levels of the ground state of the cesium- 133 atom.

 

(1967)
Electric ampere A The ampere is that constant current which, if maintained in
current two straight parallel conductors of inﬁnite length, of negligible

circular cross-section, and placed 1 metre apart in vacuum,
would produce between these conductors a force equal to 2><107
newton per metre of length. (1948]

Thermo kelvin K The kelvin, is the fraction 1 /273. 16 of the thermodynamic

dynamic temperature of the triple point of water. (1967)

Temperature

Amount of mole mol The mole is the amount of substance of a system, which contains

substance as many elementary entities as there are atoms in 0.012
kilogram of carbon - 12. (1971)

Luminous candela cd The candela is the luminous intensity, in a given

intensity direction, of a source that emits monochromatic radiation of

frequency 540x1012 hertz and that has a radiant intensity in
that direction of 1 / 683 watt per steradian. (1979)

* The values mentioned here need not be remembered or asked in a test. They are given here only to indicate the
extent of accuracy to which they are measured. With progress in technology, the measuring techniques get
improved leading to measurements with greater precision. The deﬁnitions of base units are revised to keep up
with this progress.
