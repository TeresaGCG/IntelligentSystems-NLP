Wove Optics

 

obstacles, how is it that the students are unable to see each
other even though they can converse easily.

(e) Ray optics is based on the assumption that light travels in a
straight line. Diffraction effects (observed when light propagates
through small apertures/slits or around small obstacles)
disprove this assumption. Yet the ray optics assumption is so
commonly used in understanding location and several other
properties of images in optical instruments. What is the
justification?

10.18 Two towers on top of two hills are 40 km apart. The line joining
them passes 50 m above a hill halfway between the towers. What is
the longest wavelength of radio waves, which can be sent between
the towers without appreciable diffraction effects?

10.19 A parallel beam of light of wavelength 500 nm falls on a narrow slit
and the resulting diffraction pattern is observed on a screen 1 m
away. It is observed that the first minimum is at a distance of 2.5
mm from the centre of the screen. Find the width of the slit.

10.20 Answer the following questions:

(a) When a low ï¬‚ying aircraft passes overhead, we sometimes notice
a slight shaking of the picture on our TV screen. Suggest a
possible explanation.

(b) As you have learnt in the text, the principle of linear
superposition of wave displacement is basic to understanding
intensity distributions in diffraction and interference patterns.
What is the justification of this principle?

10.21 In deriving the single slit diffraction pattern, it was stated that the
intensity is zero at angles of n/l/ a. Justify this by suitably dividing
the slit to bring out the cancellation.
