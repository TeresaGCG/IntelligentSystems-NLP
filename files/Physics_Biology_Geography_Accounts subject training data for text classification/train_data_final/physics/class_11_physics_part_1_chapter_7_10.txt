SYSTEMS OI’ PARTICLES AND ROTA'I‘IONAL MOTION

We shall now define another product of two
vectors. This product is a vector. Two important
quantities in the study of rotational motion,
namely, moment of a force and angular
momentum, are defined as vector products.

Deﬁnition of Vector Product

A vector product of two vectors a and b is a
vector c such that

(i) magnitude of c = c = ab sin 0 where a and b
are magnitudes of a and b and 6 is the
angle between the two vectors.

(ii) c is perpendicular to the plane containing
a and b.

(iii) if we take a right handed screw with its head
lying in the plane of a and b and the screw
perpendicular to this plane, and if we turn
the head in the direction from a to b, then
the tip of the screw advances in the direction
of c. This right handed screw rule is
illustrated in Fig. 7 . 15a.

Alternately, if one curls up the fingers of
right hand around a line perpendicular to the
plane of the vectors a and b and if the fingers
are curled up in the direction from a to b, then
the stretched thumb points in the direction of
c, as shown in Fig. 7.15b.

Fig. 7.15 (a) Rule of the right handed screw for
defining the direction of the vector
product of two vectors.

(b) Rule of the right hand for deﬁning the
direction of the vector product.

A simpler version of the right hand rule is
the following : Open up your right hand palm
and curl the fingers pointing from a to b. Your
stretched thumb points in the direction of c.

It should be remembered that there are two
angles between any two vectors a and b . In
Fig. 7 .15 (a) or (b) they correspond to 6 (as
shown) and (3600— 6). While applying either of
the above rules, the rotation should be taken
through the smaller angle (<1800) between a
and b. It is 0 here.

Because of the cross (x) used to denote the
vector product, it is also referred to as cross product.

0 Note that scalar product of two vectors is

commutative as said earlier, a.b = b.a

The vector product, however, is not
commutative, i.e. aXb #2 bXa

The magnitude of both aXb and bXa is the
same (ab sing): also, both of them are
perpendicular to the plane of a and b. But the
rotation of the right-handed screw in case of
aXb is from a to b, whereas in case of bXa it
is from b to a. This means the two vectors are
in opposite directions. We have

a x b = —b x a

0 Another interesting property of a vector

product is its behaviour under reﬂection.
Under reﬂection (i.e. on taking the plane
mirror image) we have

x —> —x,y —> —y and z —> —z. As a result all
the components of a vector change sign and

thus a —> —a, b —> —b . What happens to
aXb under reﬂection?
aXb—>(—a)><(—b)=a><b
Thus, aXb does not change sign under
reﬂection.
0 Both scalar and vector products are

distributive with respect to vector addition.
Thus,

a.(b + c) = a.b + a.c

ax(b+c)=a><b+a><c

0 We may write c = aXb in the component
form. For this we first need to obtain some
elementary cross products:

(i) mm = 0 (0 is a null vector, i.e. a vector
with zero magnitude)

This follows since magnitude of aXa is

a2 sin0°=0-
