Alternating Current

Example 7.10 At an airport. a person is made to walk through the
doorway of a metal detector. for security reasons. If she/ he is carrying
anything made of metal. the metal detector emits a sound. On what
principle does this detector work?

Solution The metal detector works on the principle of resonance in
ac circuits. When you walk through a metal detector. you are.
in fact. walking through a coil of many turns. The coil is connected to
a capacitor tuned so that the circuit is in resonance. When
you walk through with metal in your pocket. the impedance of the
circuit changes â€” resulting in significant change in current in the
circuit. This change in current is detected and the electronic circuitry
causes a sound to be emitted as an alarm.

is increasing; so the
polarity of induced emf in
the inductor is as shown.
