there is no need to treat angular velocity as a
vector. Further, the angular acceleration, 06 =

dw/dt.

The kinematical quantities in rotational
motion, angular displacement (9), angular
velocity ((0) and angular acceleration (a)
respectively are analogous to kinematic
quantities in linear motion, displacement (x),
velocity (v) and acceleration (a). We know the
kinematical equations of linear motion with
uniform (i.e. constant) acceleration:

v = v0 + at (a)
1

x=xO +120t+§at2 (b)

v2 = v3 + 2ax (C)

where x0 = initial displacement and v0= initial
velocity. The word ‘initial’ refers to values of the
quantities at t = 0

The corresponding kinematic equations for
rotational motion with uniform angular
acceleration are:

a): 600 + at (7.38)
0 = 00 + wot + g at2 (7.39)
and aﬁ = 6002 + 2040— 00) (7.40)

where 60: initial angular displacement of the
rotating body, and (00 = initial angular velocity
of the body.

> Example 7.13 Obtain Eq. (7.38) from ﬁrst
principles.

Answer The angular acceleration is uniform,
hence

E = a = constant (i)
dt

Integrating this equation,

w=Iadt+c

= at + c (as a is constant)

At t = 0, a) = (00 (given)

From (i) we getat t=0, w= c= (00

Thus, (0 = at + (00 as required.

With the definition of co = dO/dt we may
integrate Eq. (7.38) to get Eq. (7.39). This
derivation and the derivation of Eq. (7.40) is
left as an exercise.

) Example 7.14 The angular speed of a
motor wheel is increased from 1200 rpm
to 3120 rpm in 16 seconds. (i) What is its

angular acceleration, assuming the
acceleration to be uniform? (ii) How many
revolutions does the engine make during
this tiIDE?

 

Answer

(i) We shall use a) = 600 + at
coo = initial angular speed in rad / s

= 27: X angular speed in rev/s

27x >< angular speed in rev/ min
60 s/min

= 27r><1200 rad/s
60

= 407: rad/s
Similarly a) = final angular speed in rad/s
27; x 3 1 20
60

27: X 52 rad/s
104 7rrad/s

rad / s

Angular acceleration

= 4 7r rad/s2
