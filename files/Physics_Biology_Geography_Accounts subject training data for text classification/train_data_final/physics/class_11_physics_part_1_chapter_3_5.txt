calculation. Let us take At = 2 s centred at
t = 4 s. Then, by the definition of the average
velocity, the slope of line P1P2 ( Fig. 3.6) gives
the value of average velocity over the interval
3 s to 5 s. Now, we decrease the value of Atfrom
2 s to 1 s. Then line P1P2 becomes @192 and its
slope gives the value of the average velocity over
the interval 3.5 s to 4.5 s. In the limit At —> 0,
the line P1P2 becomes tangent to the position-
time curve at the point P and the velocity at t =
4 s is given by the slope of the tangent at that
point. It is difficult to show this process
graphically. But if we use numerical method
to obtain the value of the velocity, the
meaning of the limiting process becomes
clear. For the graph shown in
Fig. 3.6, X: 0.08 t3. Table 3.1 gives the value of
Ax/At calculated for Atequal to 2.0 s, 1.0 s, 0.5
s, 0.1 s and 0.01 s centred at t= 4.0 s. The
second and third columns give the value of t1=

Atl ' ( At\

[t - 7) and t2 = ngJ and the fourth and

the fifth columns give the corresponding values

of x, i.e. x(tl) = 0.08 If and x(t2) = 0.08 I; The
sixth column lists the difference Ax = x (t2) —
(t1) and the last column gives the ratio of Ax and
At, i.e. the average velocity corresponding to the
value of At listed in the first column.

We see from Table 3.1 that as we decrease
the value ofAtfrom 2.0 s to 0.010 s, the value of
the average velocity approaches the limiting
value 3.84 m S'1 which is the value of velocity at

dx

t= 4.0 s, i.e. the value of E at 1:: 4.0 s. In this

manner, we can calculate velocity at each

The graphical method for the determination
of the instantaneous velocity is always not a
convenient method. For this, we must carefully
plot the position—time graph and calculate the
value of average velocity as At becomes smaller
and smaller. It is easier to calculate the value
of velocity at different instants if we have data
of positions at different instants or exact
expression for the position as a function of time.
Then, we calculate Ax/ At from the data for
decreasing the value of At and find the limiting
value as we have done in Table 3.1 or use
differential calculus for the given expression and

dx

calculate d—t at different instants as done in

the following example.
