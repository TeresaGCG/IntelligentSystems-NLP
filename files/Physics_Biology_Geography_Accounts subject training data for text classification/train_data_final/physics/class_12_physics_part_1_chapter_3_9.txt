depending on their resistivities, in an increasing order of their values.
Metals have low resistivities in the range of 10”8 52m to 1045 52m. At the
other end are insulators like ceramic, rubber and plastics having
resistivities 1018 times greater than metals or more. In between the two
are the semiconductors. These, however, have resistivities
characteristically decreasing with a rise in temperature. The resistivities
of semiconductors are also affected by presence of small amount of
impurities. This last feature is exploited in use of semiconductors for
electronic devices.

Commercially produced resistors for domestic use or in laboratories
are of two major types: wire bound resistors and carbon resistors. Wire
bound resistors are made by winding the wires of an alloy, viz., manganin,
constantan, nichrome or similar ones. The choice of these materials is
dictated mostly by the fact that their resistivities are relatively insensitive
to temperature. These resistances are typically in the range of a fraction
of an ohm to a few hundred ohms.
