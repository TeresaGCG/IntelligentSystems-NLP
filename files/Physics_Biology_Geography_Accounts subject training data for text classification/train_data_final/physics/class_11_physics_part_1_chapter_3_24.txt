MOTION IN A STRAIGHT LINE 63

 

To calculate the area under this curve [Fig 3.3 1 (ii)], let us employ the following trick. Divide the
interval on x—axis from a to b into a large number (N) of small intervals: x0(=a) to x1, x1 to x2 ; x2 to x3,
................................ xNJ to xN (=b). The area under the curve is thus divided into N strips. Each strip
is approximately a rectangle, since the variation of Ex) over a strip is negligible. The area of the it“
strip shown [Fig 3.3 1(ii)] is then approximately

Mi 2 F(Xi)(xi —Xi_1): F(Xi)AX

where Axis the width of the strip which we have taken to be the same for all the strips. You may
wonder whether we should put Ext-,1) or the mean of HXJ and Ext, 1) in the above expression. If we
take N to be very very large (New ), it does not really matter, since then the strip will be so thin that
the difference between FIxi) and H29: 1) is vanishingly small. The total area under the curve then is:

N N
A = 2AA, = ZFDq-Mx
i=1 i=1

The limit of this sum as New is known as the integral of Ex) over xfrom a to b. It is given a special
symbol as shown below:

b
A _ J: F(x)dx

The integral sign J looks like an elongated S, reminding us that it basically is the limit of the sum

of an infinite number of terms.
A most significant mathematical fact is that integration is, in a sense, an inverse of differentiation.

The function g (x) is known as the indefinite integral off (x) and is denoted as:

 

Suppose we have a function g (x) whose derivative is f (x), i.e. f (X) =

gtx) = J fix)dx

An integral with lower and upper limits is known as a definite integral. It is a number. Indefinite
integral has no limits; it is a function.

A fundamental theorem of mathematics states that

b
J fix) dx = gtx) l: a gib) — 9(a)

As an example, suppose f (x) = x2 and we wish to determine the value of the definite integral from
x =1 to x = 2. The function g (x) whose derivative is x2 is x3 / 3. Therefore,

Clearly, to evaluate definite integrals, we need to know the corresponding indefinite integrals. Some
common indefinite integrals are
