quantity. Thus, the dimensional equations are
the equations, which represent the dimensions
of a physical quantity in terms of the base
quantities. For example, the dimensional
equations of volume [V], speed [1)], force [F] and
mass density [p] may be expressed as

[V] = [M0 L310]
[v1 = [M0 LTI]
[F] = [M LTZ]

[p1 = [M L-3 T0]

The dimensional equation can be obtained
from the equation representing the relations
between the physical quantities. The
dimensional formulae of a large number and
wide variety of physical quantities, derived from
the equations representing the relationships
among other physical quantities and expressed
in terms of base quantities are given in
Appendix 9 for your guidance and ready
reference.

2.10 DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS AND ITS
APPLICATIONS

The recognition of concepts of dimensions, which
guide the description of physical behaviour is
of basic importance as only those physical
quantities can be added or subtracted which
have the same dimensions. A thorough
understanding of dimensional analysis helps us
in deducing certain relations among different
physical quantities and checking the derivation,
accuracy and dimensional consistency or
homogeneity of various mathematical
expressions. When magnitudes of two or more
physical quantities are multiplied, their units
should be treated in the same manner as
ordinary algebraic symbols. We can cancel
identical units in the numerator and
denominator. The same is true for dimensions
of a physical quantity. Similarly, physical
quantities represented by symbols on both sides
of a mathematical equation must have the same
dimensions.

2.10.1 Checking the Dimensional
Consistency of Equations

The magnitudes of physical quantities may be
added together or subtracted from one another
only if they have the same dimensions. In other
words, we can add or subtract similar physical
quantities. Thus, velocity cannot be added to
force, or an electric current cannot be subtracted

from the thermodynamic temperature. This
simple principle called the principle of
homogeneity of dimensions in an equation is
extremely useful in checking the correctness of
an equation. If the dimensions of all the terms
are not same, the equation is wrong. Hence, if
we derive an expression for the length (or
distance) of an object, regardless of the symbols
appearing in the original mathematical relation,
when all the individual dimensions are
simplified, the remaining dimension must be
that of length. Similarly, if we derive an equation
of speed, the dimensions on both the sides of
equation, when simplified, must be of length/
time, or [L T1].

Dimensions are customarily used as a
preliminary test of the consistency of an
equation, when there is some doubt about the
correctness of the equation. However, the
dimensional consistency does not guarantee
correct equations. It is uncertain to the extent
of dimensionless quantities or functions. The
arguments of special functions, such as the
trigonometric, logarithmic and exponential
functions must be dimensionless. A pure
number, ratio of similar physical quantities,
such as angle as the ratio (length/length),
refractive index as the ratio (speed of light in
vacuum / speed of light in medium) etc., has no
dimensions.

Now we can test the dimensional consistency
or homogeneity of the equation

x=x0 +v0 t+(l/2)at2
for the distance x travelled by a particle or body
in time twhich starts from the position x0 with
an initial velocity Do at time t= O and has uniform
acceleration a along the direction of motion.
The dimensions of each term may be written as

[x] = [L]
[x0] = [L]
[Do 13] = [L "Iâ€˜ll [T]
= [L]
[(1/2) a t2] = [LT2] [T2]
= [L]

As each term on the right hand side of this
equation has the same dimension, namely that
of length, which is same as the dimension of
left hand side of the equation, hence this
equation is a dimensionally correct equation.
It may be noted that a test of consistency of
dimensions tells us no more and no less than a
