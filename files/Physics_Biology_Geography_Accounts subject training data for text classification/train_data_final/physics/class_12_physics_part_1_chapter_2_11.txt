directly proportional to the product
of charges and inversely to the Obviously, if q2 was brought first to its present location and
distance between them. q1 brought later, the potential energy Uwould be the same.

More generally, the potential energy expression,
Eq. (2.22), is unaltered whatever way the charges are brought to the speciﬁed
locations, because of path-independence of work for electrostatic force.

Equation (2.22) is true for any sign of qland (12. If q1q2 > 0, potential
energy is positive. This is as expected, since for like charges (q1q2 > O),
electrostatic force is repulsive and a positive amount of work is needed to
be done against this force to bring the charges from infinity to a finite
distance apart. For unlike charges (q1 q2 < O), the electrostatic force is
attractive. In that case, a positive amount of work is needed against this
force to take the charges from the given location to inﬁnity. In other words,
a negative amount of work is needed for the reverse path (from infinity to
the present locations), so the potential energy is negative.

Equation (2.22) is easily generalised for a system of any number of
point charges. Let us calculate the potential energy of a system of three
charges q1, q2 and q3 located at r1, r2, :3, respectively. To bring q1 first
from inﬁnity to r1, no work is required. Next we bring q2 from infinity to
:2. As before, work done in this step is

Again, because of the conservative nature of the
electrostatic force (or equivalently, the path
independence of work done), the ﬁnal expression for
