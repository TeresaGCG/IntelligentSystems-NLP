1. 12 DIPOLE IN A UNIFORM EXTERNAL FIELD

Consider a permanent dipole of dipole moment p in a uniform qE
external field E, as shown in Fig. 1.22. (By permanent dipole, we
mean that p exists irrespective of E; it has not been induced by E.) IE

There is a force qE on q and a force —qE on —q. The net force on
the dipole is zero, since E is uniform. However, the charges are _q
separated, so the forces act at different points, resulting in a torque
on the dipole. When the net force is zero, the torque (couple) is
independent of the origin. Its magnitude equals the magnitude of FIGURE 1-22 Di100le in a
each force multiplied by the arm of the couple (perpendicular uniform 6190”“ ﬁeld-
distance between the two antiparallel forces).

Magnitude of torque = q E X 2 a sine

= 2 q a E sin6
Its direction is normal to the plane of the paper, coming out of it.
The magnitude of p X E is also p E sine and its direction E

is normal to the paper, coming out of it. Thus,

This torque will tend to align the dipole with the ﬁeld 0" __ O

will, in general, be a torque on the system as before. The

 

general case is involved, so let us consider the simpler (a)

situations when p is parallel to E or antiparallel to E. In

either case, the net torque is zero, but there is a net force E

on the dipole if E is not uniform.

This brings us to a common observation in frictional (b)

electricity. A comb run through dry hair attracts pieces of FIGURE 123 Electric force on a
