then, the displacement produced by 82 would be
y2 = acos (wt+ ¢)
and the resultant displacement will be given by

y = U1 + H2
= a [cos wt + cos (wt +¢)]

= 2 acos ((M2) cos (wt+ ¢/2)

[ cosA+cosB = 2cos£AgBj cos[A;B]]

The amplitude of the resultant displacement is 2a cos (¢/ 2) and
therefore the intensity at that point will be

1 = 4 10 cos2 (¢/2) (10.12)

If ¢ = O, i 2 TC, i 4 at,... which corresponds to the condition given by
Eq. (10.10) we will have constructive interference leading to maximum
intensity. On the other hand, if q) = i TC, i 37:, i 5% [which corresponds to
the condition given by Eq. (1 0.1 1)] we will have destructive interference
leading to zero intensity.

Now if the two sources are coherent (i.e., if the two needles are going
up and down regularly) then the phase difference ¢ at any point will not
change with time and we will have a stable interference pattern; i.e., the
positions of maxima and minima will not change with time. However, if
the two needles do not maintain a constant phase difference, then the
interference pattern will also change with time and, if the phase difference
changes very rapidly with time, the positions of maXima and minima will
also vary rapidly with time and we will see a “time-averaged” intensity
distribution. When this happens, we will observe an average intensity
that will be given by

 

 

<I>=410 <cos2(¢/2)> (10.13)

where angular brackets represent time averaging. Indeed it is shown in
Section 7.2 that if ¢(t) varies randomly with time, the time-averaged
quantity < cos2 (¢/ 2) > will be 1 / 2. This is also intuitively obvious because
the function cos2 (¢/ 2) will randomly vary between 0 and 1 and the
average value will be 1 / 2. The resultant intensity will be given by

1:210 (10.14)

at all points.

When the phase difference between the two vibrating sources changes
rapidly with time, we say that the two sources are incoherent and when
this happens the intensities just add up. This is indeed what happens
when two separate light sources illuminate a wall.

10.5 INTERFERENCE OF LIGHT WAVES AND YOUNG’S
EXPERIMENT

We will now discuss interference using light waves. If we use two sodium
lamps illuminating two pinholes (Fig. 10. 1 1) we will not observe any
interference fringes. This is because of the fact that the light wave emitted
from an ordinary source (like a sodium lamp) undergoes abrupt phase
