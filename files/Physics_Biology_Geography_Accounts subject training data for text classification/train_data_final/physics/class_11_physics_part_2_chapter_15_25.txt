where xand y are in cm and tin s. Calculate the phase difference between oscillatory
motion of two points separated by a distance of

The transverse displacement of a string [clamped at its both ends) is given by
27:
y[x, t] = 0.06 sin (3X) cos [120 711]

where x and y are in m and tin s. The length of the string is 1.5 m and its mass is
3.0 X 10’2 kg.

Answer the following :
[a] Does the function represent a travelling wave or a stationary wave?

[b] Interpret the wave as a superposition of two waves travelling in opposite
directions. What is the wavelength, frequency, and speed of each wave ?

[c] Determine the tension in the string.

[i] For the wave on a string described in Exercise 15.1 1, do all the points on the
string oscillate with the same [a] frequency, [b] phase, (0) amplitude? Explain
your answers. (ii) What is the amplitude of a point 0.375 m away from one end?

Given below are some functions of xand tto represent the displacement [transverse
or longitudinal] of an elastic wave. State which of these represent [i] a travelling
wave, [ii] a stationary wave or (iii) none at all:

[a] y = 2 cos [3x) sin [100

[b] y =2xlx — vt
[c] y = 3 sin [5x— 0.5t) + 4 cos (5x— 0.5t)

[d] y = cos xsin t+ cos 2x sin 2t

A wire stretched between two rigid supports vibrates in its fundamental mode with
a frequency of 45 Hz. The mass of the wire is 3.5 X 10’2 kg and its linear mass density
is 4.0 X 10‘2 kg m‘l. What is (a) the speed of a transverse wave on the string, and
[b] the tension in the string?

A metre—long tube open at one end, with a movable piston at the other end, shows
resonance with a fixed frequency source (a tuning fork of frequency 340 Hz] when
the tube length is 25.5 cm or 79.3 cm. Estimate the speed of sound in air at the
temperature of the experiment. The edge effects may be neglected.

A steel rod 100 cm long is clamped at its middle. The fundamental frequency of
longitudinal vibrations of the rod are given to be 2.53 kHz. What is the speed of
sound in steel?

A pipe 20 cm long is closed at one end. Which harmonic mode of the pipe is
resonantly excited by a 430 Hz source ? Will the same source be in resonance with
the pipe if both ends are open? [speed of sound in air is 340 m s4].

Two sitar strings A and B playing the note ‘Ga’ are slightly out of tune and produce
beats of frequency 6 Hz. The tension in the string A is slightly reduced and the
