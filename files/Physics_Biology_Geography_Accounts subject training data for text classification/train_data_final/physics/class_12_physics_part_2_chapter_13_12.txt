EXAMPLE 13.6

 

Example 13.6 We are given the following atomic masses:
2§§U = 23805079 u §He= 4.00260 u
233m = 234.04363 u iH= 1.00783 u

ZSZPa = 23705121 u

Here the symbol Pa is for the element protactinium (Z = 91).
(a) Calculate the energy released during the alpha decay of 2328U.

(b) Show that 2§§U can not spontaneously emit a proton.
Solution
(a) The alpha decay of 238U is given by Eq. (13.20). The energy released

92
in this process is given by
Q= (MU—Mm—MH.) c2
Substituting the atomic masses as given in the data, we ﬁnd
Q = (23805079 — 234.04363 — 4.00260)u X 02
- (0.00456 u) c2
(0.00456 u) (931.5 MeV/u)

= 4.25 MeV.

(b) If 2g§U spontaneously emits a proton, the decay process would be

2:311 —> 33a + 1H
The Q for this process to happen is

(MU — MPa — MH) c2

(238.05079 — 237.05121 — 1.00783) u X c2

(— 0.00825 u) c2

(0.00825 u)(931.5 MeV/u)

= — 7.68 MeV

Thus, the Q of the process is negative and therefore it cannot proceed
spontaneously. We will have to supply an energy of 7.68 MeV to a

2§§U nucleus to make it emit a proton.

13.6.3 Beta decay

In beta decay, a nucleus spontaneously emits an electron (ff—decay) or a
positron (6+ decay). A common example of [3' decay is

f:P->f§S+e‘+1—/ (13.22)
and that of [3+ decay is

§§Na —> f3Ne+ e+ + v (13.23)

The decays are governed by the Eqs. (13.14) and (13.1 5), so that one
can never predict which nucleus will undergo decay, but one can
characterize the decay by a half-life T1/2 . For example, T1/2 for the decays
above is respectively 14.3 d and 2.6y. The emission of electron in B'decay
is accompanied by the emission of an antineutrino (17 ); in b” decay, instead,
a neutrino (v) is generated. Neutrinos are neutral particles with very small
(possiblly, even zero) mass compared to electrons. They have only weak
interaction with other particles. They are, therefore, very difﬁcult to detect,
since they can penetrate large quantity of matter (even earth) without any
interaction.
