where n21 is the total number of turns of S2. From Eq. (6.12),
M21 = ,uon1n2nrfl (6.13)
Using Eq. (6.1 1) and Eq. (6.12), we get
M12: M21: M (say) (6.14)

We have demonstrated this equality for long co-axial solenoids.
However, the relation is far more general. Note that if the inner solenoid
was much shorter than (and placed well inside) the outer solenoid, then
we could still have calculated the ﬂux linkage N1<I>1 because the inner
solenoid is effectively immersed in a uniform magnetic field due to the
outer solenoid. In this case, the calculation of M12 would be easy. However,
it would be extremely difficult to calculate the ﬂux linkage with the outer
solenoid as the magnetic ﬁeld due to the inner solenoid would vary across
the length as well as cross section of the outer solenoid. Therefore, the
calculation of M21 would also be extremely difficult in this case. The
equality M12=M21 is very useful in such situations.

We explained the above example with air as the medium within the
solenoids. Instead, if a medium of relative permeability yr had been present,
the mutual inductance would be

M=Mo nlngn Til

It is also important to know that the mutual inductance of a pair of
coils, solenoids, etc., depends on their separation as well as their relative
orientation.

Example 6.9 Two concentric circular coils, one of small radius r1 and
the other of large radius r , such that r1 << r2, are placed co-axially
with centres coinciding. Obtain the mutual inductance of the
arrangement.

Solution Let a current I2 ﬂow through the outer circular coil. The
field at the centre of the coil is 82 = ,uOI2 / 2r2. Since the other
co-axially placed coil has a very small radius, 82 may be considered
constant over its cross-sectional area. Hence,

Note that we calculated M12 from an approximate value of 9151, assuming
the magnetic field 32 to be uniform over the area 7: r12. However, we
can accept this value because r1 << r2.
