ﬁssion. It contains the fuel elements in suitably fabricated form. The fuel
may be say enriched uranium (i.e., one that has greater abundance of
2351} than naturally occurring uranium). The core contains a moderator
to slow down the neutrons. The core is surrounded by a reﬂector to reduce
leakage. The energy (heat) released in ﬁssion is continuously removed by
a suitable coolant. A containment vessel prevents the escape of radioactive
ﬁssion products. The whole assembly is shielded to check harmful
radiation from coming out. The reactor can be shut down by means of
rods (made of, for example, cadmium) that have high absorption of
neutrons. The coolant transfers heat to a working ﬂuid which in turn
may produce stream. The steam drives turbines and generates electricity.

Like any power reactor, nuclear reactors generate considerable waste
products. But nuclear wastes need special care for treatment since they
are radioactive and hazardous. Elaborate safety measures, both for reactor
operation as well as handling and reprocessing the spent fuel, are
required. These safety measures are a distinguishing feature of the Indian
Atomic Energy programme. An appropriate plan is being evolved to study
the possibility of converting radioactive waste into less active and short-

lived material.

13.7.3 Nuclear fusion — energy generation in stars

When two light nuclei fuse to form a larger nucleus, energy is released,
since the larger nucleus is more tightly bound, as seen from the binding
energy curve in Fig. 13. 1. Some examples of such energy liberating nuclear
fusion reactions are :

1H4, 114s 21H + e+ + v + 0.42 MeV [13-29lall
21H+§H—>§He+ n+3.27 MeV [13.29(b)]
3H +314 _> ﬁH + {H + 4.03 MeV [1329(0)]
