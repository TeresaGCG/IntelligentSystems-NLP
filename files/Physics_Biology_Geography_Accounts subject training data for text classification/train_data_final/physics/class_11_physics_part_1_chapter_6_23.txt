6. 17 The bob A of a pendulum released from 30° to the
vertical hits another bob B of the same mass at rest
on a table as shown in Fig. 6.15. How high does
the bob A rise after the collision ? Neglect the size of
the bobs and assume the collision to be elastic.

6. 18 The bob of a pendulum is released from a horizontal
position. If the length of the pendulum is 1.5 m,
what is the speed with which the bob arrives at the
lowermost point, given that it dissipated 5% of its
initial energy against air resistance ?

6. 19 A trolley of mass 300 kg carrying a sandbag of 25 kg
is moving uniformly with a speed of 27 km/ h on a Fig. 6.15
frictionless track. After a while, sand starts leaking
out of a hole on the ﬂoor of the trolley at the rate of
0.05 kg s'l. What is the speed of the trolley after the entire sand bag is empty ?

6.20 Abody ofmass 0.5 kg travels in a straight line with velocity v =ax3/2 where a= 5 m‘“2 s‘l.
What is the work done by the net force during its displacement from x = 0 to
x = 2 m ?

6.21 The blades of a windmill sweep out a circle of area A. [a] If the wind ﬂows at a
velocity v perpendicular to the circle, what is the mass of the air passing through it
in time t ? [b] What is the kinetic energy of the air ? [c] Assume that the windmill
converts 25% of the winds energy into electrical energy, and that A = 30 m2, 1) = 36
km / h and the density of air is 1.2 kg m‘3. What is the electrical power produced ?

6.22 A person trying to lose weight [dieter] lifts a 10 kg mass, one thousand times, to a
height of 0.5 m each time. Assume that the potential energy lost each time she
lowers the mass is dissipated. [a] How much work does she do against the gravitational
force ? [b] Fat supplies 3.8 X 107J of energy per kilogram which is converted to
mechanical energy with a 20% efficiency rate. How much fat will the dieter use up?

6.23 A family uses 8 kW of power. [a] Direct solar energy is incident on the horizontal
surface at an average rate of 200 W per square meter. If 20% of this energy can be
converted to useful electrical energy, how large an area is needed to supply 8 kW?
(b) Compare this area to that of the roof of a typical house.

6.24 A bullet of mass 0.012 kg and horizontal speed 70 m s‘1 strikes a block of wood of
mass 0.4 kg and instantly comes to rest with respect to the block. The block is
suspended from the ceiling by means of thin wires. Calculate the height to which
the block rises. Also, estimate the amount of heat produced in the block.

6.25 Two inclined frictionless tracks, one gradual and the other steep meet at A from
where two stones are allowed to slide down from rest, one on each track (Fig. 6.16).
Will the stones reach the bottom at the same time? Will they reach there with the
same speed? Explain. Given 01 = 30°, 62 = 60°, and h = 10 m, what are the speeds and
times taken by the two stones ?
