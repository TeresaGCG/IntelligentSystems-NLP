quantisation of charge cannot be ignored. It is the magnitude of scale
involved that is very important.

Example 1.2 If 109 electrons move out of a body to another body
every second, how much time is required to get a total charge of l C
on the other body?

Solution In one second 109 electrons move out of the body. Therefore
the charge given out in one second is 1.6 X 10’19 X 109C = 1.6 X 10‘10 C.
The time required to accumulate a charge of l C can then be estimated
to be 1 c + (1.6 x 10—10 C/s) = 6.25 x 109 s = 6.25 x 109+ (365 x 24 x
3600) years = 198 years. Thus to collect a charge of one coulomb,
from a body from which 109 electrons move out every second, we will
need approximately 200 years. One coulomb is, therefore, a very large
unit for many practical purposes.

It is, however, also important to know what is roughly the number of
electrons contained in a piece of one cubic centimetre of a material.
A cubic piece of copper of side 1 cm contains about 2.5 X 1024
electrons.

Example 1.3 How much positive and negative charge is there in a
cup of water?

Solution Let us assume that the mass of one cup of water is
250 g. The molecular mass of water is 18g. Thus, one mole
(= 6.02 X 1023 molecules) of water is 18 g. Therefore the number of
molecules in one cup of water is (250/ 18) X 6.02 X 1023.

Each molecule of water contains two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen
atom, i.e., 10 electrons and 10 protons. Hence the total positive and
total negative charge has the same magnitude. It is equal to

(250/18) x 6.02 x 1023 x 10 x 1.6 x 10‘19 c = 1.34 x 107 c.

1 .6 COULOMB’s LAW

Coulomb’s law is a quantitative statement about the force between two
point charges. When the linear size of charged bodies are much smaller
than the distance separating them, the size may be ignored and the
charged bodies are treated as point charges. Coulomb measured the
force between two point charges and found that it varied inversely as
the square of the distance between the charges and was directly
proportional to the product of the magnitude of the two charges and
acted along the line joining the two charges. Thus, if two point charges
q1, q2 are separated by a distance r in vacuum, the magnitude of the
force (F) between them is given by

How did Coulomb arrive at this law from his experiments? Coulomb
used a torsion balance* for measuring the force between two charged metallic

F=k

 

* A torsion balance is a sensitive device to measure force. It was also used later
by Cavendish to measure the very feeble gravitational force between two obj ects,
to verify Newton’s Law of Gravitation.
