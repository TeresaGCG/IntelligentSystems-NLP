Fig. 1 5. 1 2 Stationary waves arising from superposition of two hamonic waves travelling in opposite directions.
Note that the positions of zero displacement (nodes) remain ﬁxed at all times.

positions of antinodes (where the amplitude is
the largest) are given by the largest value of sin
kx:

lsin kxl = 1
which implies

kx= (n+ 1/2) 7:; n=0, 1, 2, 3,

With k = 27r//’L, we get

x=(n+1/2)% ;n=0, 1,2, 3,... (15.39)

Again the distance between any two consecutive

antinodes is %. Eq. (15.38) can be applied to

the case of a stretched string of length L fixed
at both ends. Taking one end to be at x = O, the
boundary conditions are that x = O and x = L
are positions of nodes. The x = 0 condition is
already satisfied. The x = L node condition
requires that the length L is related to 7L by

A

Thus, the possible wavelengths of stationary
waves are constrained by the relation

We have thus obtained the natural frequencies
- the normal modes of oscillation of the system.
The lowest possible natural frequency of a
system is called its fundamental mode or the
ﬁrst harmonic. For the stretched string fixed

v
at either end it is given by v = i, corresponding
to n = 1 of Eq. (15.42). Here v is the speed of
wave determined by the properties of the
medium. The n = 2 frequency is called the
second harmonic; n = 3 is the third harmonic
