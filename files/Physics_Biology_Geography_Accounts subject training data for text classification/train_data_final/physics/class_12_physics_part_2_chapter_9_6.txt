Example 9.1 Suppose that the lower half of the concave mirror’s
reﬂecting surface in Fig. 9.5 is covered with an opaque (non-reﬂective)
material. What effect will this have on the image of an object placed
in front of the mirror?

Solution You may think that the image will now show only half of the
object, but taking the laws of reﬂection to be true for all points of the
remaining part of the mirror, the image wﬂl be that of the whole object.
However, as the area of the reﬂecting surface has been reduced, the
intensity of the image will be low (in this case, hali).

Example 9.2 A mobile phone lies along the principal axis of a concave
mirror, as shown in Fig. 9.7. Show by suitable diagram, the formation
of its image. Explain why the magniﬁcation is not uniform. Wiﬂ the
distortion of image depend on the location of the phone with respect
to the mirror?

 

 

FIGURE 9.7

Solution

The ray diagram for the formation of the image of the phone is shown
in Fig. 9.7. The image of the part which is on the plane perpendicular
to principal axis will be on the same plane. It will be of the same size,
i.e., B’C = BC. You can yourself realise why the image is distorted.

Example 9.3 An object is placed at (i) 10 cm, (ii) 5 cm in front of a
concave mirror of radius of curvature 15 cm. Find the position, nature,
and magnification of the image in each case.

Solution
The focal lengthf= —15/2 cm = —7.5 cm
(i)The object distance u = —10 cm. Then Eq. (9.7) gives

 

l L _ L
U —10 —7.5
v- le7.5 _ 30
or — _2.5 — — cm
The image is 30 cm from the mirror on the same side as the object.
. . . _ 15%“
Also, magnification m — u (_10)

The image is magniﬁed, real and inverted.
