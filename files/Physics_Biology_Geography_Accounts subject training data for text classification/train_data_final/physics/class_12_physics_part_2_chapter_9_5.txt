the object AB, image A’B’ as well as the focus F from the pole P, we have
to travel opposite to the direction of incident light. Hence, all the three

will have negative signs. Thus,
B’P=—v, FP=—f, BP=—u

Using these in Eq. (9.6), we get
— v + f — v

 

or lv_f

Dividing it by v, we get

v u f (9-7)

This relation is known as the mirror equation.
The size of the image relative to the size of the object is another
important quantity to consider. We deﬁne linear magniﬁcation (m) as the

ratio of the height of the image (h’) to the height of the object (h):

h and h’will be taken positive or negative in accordance with the accepted
sign convention. In triangles A’B’P and ABP, we have,

‘B’A’ _ B’P
BA BP
With the sign convention, this becomes
— h’ — U

h — u
so that

h’ v

h u ( )

We have derived here the mirror equation, Eq. (9.7), and the
magniﬁcation formula, Eq. (9.9), for the case of real, inverted image formed
by a concave mirror. With the proper use of sign convention, these are,
in fact, valid for all the cases of reﬂection by a spherical mirror (concave
or convex) whether the image formed is real or virtual. Figure 9.6 shows
the ray diagrams for virtual image formed by a concave and convex mirror.
You should verify that Eqs. (9.7) and (9.9) are valid for these cases as
well.
