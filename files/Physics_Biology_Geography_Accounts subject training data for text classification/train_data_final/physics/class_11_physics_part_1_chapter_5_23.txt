A stone of mass m tied to the end of a string revolves in a vertical circle of radius R.
The net forces at the lowest and highest points of the circle directed vertically
downwards are : [Choose the correct alternative]

Lowest Point Highest Point
[a] mg—T1 mg+T2
(b) mg+T1 mg—T2
{c} mg+T1—(mv%)/R mg—T2+(mvﬁ)/R
(d) mg—TI—(mvﬁl/R mg+T2+lmv%]/R

T1 and v1 denote the tension and speed at the lowest point. T2 and v2 denote
corresponding values at the highest point.

A helicopter of mass 1000 kg rises with a vertical acceleration of 15 m s‘z. The crew
and the passengers weigh 300 kg. Give the magnitude and direction of the

[a] force on the ﬂoor by the crew and passengers,

(b) action of the rotor of the helicopter on the surrounding air,

(c) force on the helicopter due to the surrounding air.

A stream of water ﬂowing horizontally with a speed of 15 m s1 gushes out of a tube of
cross—sectional area 10‘2 m2, and hits a vertical wall nearby. What is the force exerted
on the wall by the impact of water, assuming it does not rebound ?

Ten one—rupee coins are put on top of each other on a table. Each coin has a mass m
Give the magnitude and direction of

[a] the force on the 7th coin [counted from the bottom) due to all the coins on its top,

(b) the force on the 7th coin by the eighth coin,
[c] the reaction of the 6th coin on the 7th coin.

An aircraft executes a horizontal loop at a speed of 720 km / h with its wings banked
at 15°. What is the radius of the loop ?

A train runs along an unbanked circular track of radius 30 m at a speed of 54 km/ h.
The mass of the train is 106 kg. What provides the centripetal force required for this
purpose — The engine or the rails ? What is the angle of banking required to prevent
wearing out of the rail ?

A block of mass 25 kg is raised by a 50 kg man in two different ways as shown in
Fig. 5.19. What is the action on the ﬂoor by the man in the two cases ? If the ﬂoor
yields to a normal force of 700 N, which mode should the man adopt to lift the block
without the ﬂoor yielding ?
