earth’s magnetic field at the place is 0.39 G, and the angle of dip is

35°. The magnetic declination is nearly zero. What are the resultant

magnetic ﬁelds at points 4.0 cm below the cable?

A compass needle free to turn in a horizontal plane is placed at the

centre of circular coil of 30 turns and radius 12 cm. The coil is in a

vertical plane making an angle of 45° with the magnetic meridian.

When the current in the coil is 0.35 A, the needle points west to

east.

(a) Determine the horizontal component of the earth’s magnetic field
at the location.

(b) The current in the coil is reversed, and the coil is rotated about
its vertical axis by an angle of 90° in the anticlockwise sense
looking from above. Predict the direction of the needle. Take the
magnetic declination at the places to be zero.

A magnetic dipole is under the inﬂuence of two magnetic ﬁelds. The
angle between the field directions is 60°, and one of the ﬁelds has a
magnitude of 1.2 X 10’2 T. If the dipole comes to stable equilibrium at
an angle of 15° with this field, what is the magnitude of the other
field?

A monoenergetic (18 keV) electron beam initially in the horizontal
direction is subjected to a horizontal magnetic field of 0.04 G normal
to the initial direction. Estimate the up or down deﬂection of the
beam over a distance of 30 cm (me = 9.11 X 10’31 kg). [Note: Data in
this exercise are so chosen that the answer will give you an idea of
the effect of earth’s magnetic ﬁeld on the motion of the electron beam
from the electron gun to the screen in a TV set.]

A sample of paramagnetic salt contains 2.0 X 1024 atomic dipoles
each of dipole moment 1.5 X 10’23 J T4. The sample is placed under
a homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld of 0.64 T, and cooled to a temperature
of 4.2 K. The degree of magnetic saturation achieved is equal to 15%.
What is the total dipole moment of the sample for a magnetic field of
0.98 T and a temperature of 2.8 K? (Assume Curie’s law)

A Rowland ring of mean radius 15 cm has 3500 turns of wire wound
on a ferromagnetic core of relative permeability 800. What is the
magnetic field B in the core for a magnetising current of 1.2 A?

The magnetic moment vectors us and "1 associated with the intrinsic
spin angular momentum S and orbital angular momentum 1,
respectively, of an electron are predicted by quantum theory (and
veriﬁed experimentally to a high accuracy) to be given by:

u, = -(e/ m) S,
111 = -(e/2m)l

Which of these relations is in accordance with the result expected
classically? Outline the derivation of the classical result.
