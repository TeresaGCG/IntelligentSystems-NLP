Fig. 10.15 indicates that the intensity has a
central maximum at 6 = 0 and other
secondary maxima at 0 z (n+1 / 2) l/ a, and
has minima (zero intensity) at 6 z n1 / a,
n= :1, i2, i3, It is easy to see why it has
minima at these values of angle. Consider
ﬁrst the angle 0where the path difference a0
is A. Then,

M1 in LM, there is a point M2 in MN such that

M1M2 = a/ 2. The path difference between M1 and M2 at P = MZP — MlP
= 0a/ 2 = 1/2 for the angle chosen. This means that the contributions
from M1 and M2 are 180° out of phase and cancel in the direction
9 = l/ a. Contributions from the two halves of the slit LM and MN,
therefore, cancel each other. Equation (10.22) gives the angle at which
the intensity falls to zero. One can similarly show that the intensity is
zero for 6 = nl/ a, with n being any integer (except zerol). Notice that the
angular size of the central maximum increases when the slit width a
decreases.

It is also easy to see why there are maxima at 6 = (n + 1 / 2) M a and
why they go on becoming weaker and weaker with increasing n. Consider
an angle 9 = 31/ 2a which is midway between two of the dark fringes.
Divide the slit into three equal parts. If we take the first two thirds of the
slit, the path difference between the two ends would be

The first two-thirds of the slit can therefore be divided
into two halves which have a A/ 2 path difference. The —>
contributions of these two halves cancel in the same manner —>
as described earlier. Only the remaining one-third of the —>
slit contributes to the intensity at a point between the two —>
minima. Clearly, this will be much weaker than the central —>
maximum (where the entire slit contributes in phase). One
can similarly show that there are maxima at (n + 1 / 2) l/ a T
with n = 2, 3, etc. These become weaker with increasing n, Incoming
since only one-ﬁfth, one-seventh, etc., of the slit contributes wave (a)
in these cases. The photograph and intensity pattern

corresponding to it is shown in Fig. 10.16.
