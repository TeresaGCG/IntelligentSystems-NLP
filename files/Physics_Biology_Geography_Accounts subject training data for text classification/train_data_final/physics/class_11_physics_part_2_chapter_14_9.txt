Answer Let the mass be displaced by a small
distance x to the right side of the equilibrium
position, as shown in Fig. 14.15. Under this
situation the spring on the left side gets

elongated by a length equal to x and that on
the right side gets compressed by the same
length. The forces acting on the mass are
then,

F1 = —kx (force exerted by the spring on

the left side, trying to pull the
mass towards the mean
position)

F2 = —kx (force exerted by the spring on
the right side, trying to push the
mass towards the mean
position)

The net force, F, acting on the mass is then
given by,

F =—2kx

Hence the force acting on the mass is
proportional to the displacement and is directed
towards the mean position; therefore, the motion
executed by the mass is simple harmonic. The
time period of oscillations is,

14.7 ENERGY IN SIMPLE HARMONIC
MOTION

Both kinetic and potential energies of a particle
in SHM vary between zero and their maximum
values.

In section 14.5 we have seen that the velocity
of a particle executing SHM, is a periodic
function of time. It is zero at the extreme positions
of displacement. Therefore, the kinetic energy (K)
of such a particle, which is defined as

K=lmv2

2

= g m (02A2 sin2(a)t + ¢)

=ékA2sin2(wt+¢) (14.15)

is also a periodic function of time, being zero
when the displacement is maximum and
maximum when the particle is at the mean
position. Note, since the sign of v is immaterial
in K, the period of K is T/ 2.

What is the potential energy (U) of a particle
executing simple harmonic motion? In
Chapter 6, we have seen that the concept of
potential energy is possible only for conservative
forces. The spring force F = —kx is a conservative
force, with associated potential energy

1
U=§kx2 (14.16)

Hence the potential energy of a particle
executing simple harmonic motion is,

U(x) = l kx2
2
=ékA2c052(a)t+¢) (14.17)

Thus, the potential energy of a particle
executing simple harmonic motion is also
periodic, with period T/ 2, being zero at the mean
position and maximum at the extreme
displacements.
