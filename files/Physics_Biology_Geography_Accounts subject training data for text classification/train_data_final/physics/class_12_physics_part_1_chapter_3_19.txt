Example 3.5 A network of resistors is connected to a 16 V battery
with internal resistance of 19, as shown in Fig. 3.19: (a) Compute
the equivalent resistance of the network. (b) Obtain the current in
each resistor. (c) Obtain the voltage drops VAB, VBC and VCD.

Solution
(a) The network is a simple series and parallel combination of
resistors. First the two 49 resistors in parallel are equivalent to a
resistor = [(4 X 4)/(4 + 4)] £2 = 2 Q.
In the same way, the 12 S2 and 6 S2 resistors in parallel are
equivalent to a resistor of
[(12 x 6)/(12 + 6)] $2 = 4 Q
The equivalent resistance R of the network is obtained by
combining these resistors (2 S2 and 4 S2) with 1 Q in series,
that is,
R=2S2+4Q+ 1S2=7§2.
(b) The total current I in the circuit is
I: 13 = 16V : 2A
R+r (7+1)Q
Consider the resistors between A and B. If I1 is the current in one
of the 4 £2 resistors and I2 the current in the other,
gx4=gx4
that is, I1 = I2, which is otherwise obvious from the symmetry of
the two arms. But II + I2 = I = 2 A. Thus,
5=5=1A
that is, current in each 4 Q resistor is 1 A. Current in 1 Q resistor
between B and C would be 2 A.
Now, consider the resistances between C and D. If I3 is the current
in the 12 Q resistor, and I4 in the 6 S2 resistor,
gx12=gxsneﬁq=2g
Bm,g+g=1=2A
2 4
Thus,I3= 5 A, I4= 3 A
m that is, the current in the 12 S2 resistor is (2/3) A, while the current
05 in the 6 S2 resistor is (4/3) A.
a (c) The voltage drop across AB is
E vw=gx4=1Ax4o=4m
I'd This can also be obtained by multiplying the total current between
1 12 A and B by the equivalent resistance between A and B, that is,
