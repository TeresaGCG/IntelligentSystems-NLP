and intrinsic material properties. This aspect is akin to capacitance which
for a parallel plate capacitor depends on the plate area and plate separation
(geometry) and the dielectric constant K of the intervening medium
(intrinsic material property).

Inductance is a scalar quantity. It has the dimensions of [M LZT‘2A‘2]
given by the dimensions of ﬂux divided by the dimensions of current. The
SI unit of inductance is henry and is denoted by H. It is named in honour
of Joseph Henry who discovered electromagnetic induction in USA,
independently of Faraday in England.

6.9. 1 Mutual inductance

Consider Fig. 6. 1 5 which shows two long co-axial solenoids each of length
i. We denote the radius of the inner solenoid S1 by r1 and the number of
turns per unit length by n1. The corresponding quantities for the outer
solenoid S2 are r2 and n2, respectively. Let N1 and N2 be the total number
of turns of coils S1 and S2, respectively.

When a current I2 is set up through S , it in turn sets up a magnetic
ﬂux through SI. Let us denote it by (1)1. The corresponding ﬂux linkage
with solenoid S1 is

N1 951 = M1212 (6.9)

M12 is called the mutual inductance of solenoid S1 with respect to
solenoid S2. It is also referred to as the coefﬁcient of mutual induction.

For these simple co-axial solenoids it is possible to calculate M12. The

magnetic ﬁeld due to the current I2 in S2 is ,uon212. The resulting ﬂux linkage
with coil S1 is,

N1? = (nil) (TU-12) (#011212)

= ,uon1n27tr121 12 (6.10)

where nllis the total number of turns in solenoid SI. Thus, from Eq. (6.9)
and Eq. (6.10),

M12 = ,uonlngnrfl (6.1 1)

Note that we neglected the edge effects and considered
the magnetic field ,uon212 to be uniform throughout the
length and width of the solenoid S2. This is a good
approximation keeping in mind that the solenoid is long,
implying 1 >> r2.

We now consider the reverse case. A current I1 is

passed through the solenoid S1 and the ﬂux linkage with
coil S2 is,

N243 = M I (6.12)

211

M21 is called the mutual inductance of solenoid 82 with
respect to solenoid SI.

The ﬂux due to the current I1 in S1 can be assumed to
be conﬁned solely inside S1 since the solenoids are very
long. Thus, ﬂux linkage with solenoid S2 is
