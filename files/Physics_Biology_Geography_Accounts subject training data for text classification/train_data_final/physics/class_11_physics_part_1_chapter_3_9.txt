This equation can also be obtained by
substituting the value of t from Eq. (3.6) into
Eq. (3.8). Thus, we have obtained three
important equations :

v=vO +at
l
x=v0t+—at2
2
v2 = v3 +2ax (3.11a)

connecting ﬁve quantities v0, 1), a, tand x. These
are kinematic equations of rectilinear motion
for constant acceleration.

The set of Eq. (3.11a) were obtained by
assuming that at t = O, the position of the
particle, x is 0. We can obtain a more general
equation if we take the position coordinate at t
= O as non-zero, say x0. Then Eqs. (3.1 1a) are
modified (replacing x by x— x0 ) to :

v=vO +at

x=x0+v0t+§at (3.11b)
v2 =v§ +2a(x—x0) (3.110)

b Example 3.3 Obtain equations of motion
for constant acceleration using method of

calculus.

 

Answer By definition

dv = a dt
Integrating both sides

[Ifdv = Iga dt

t
= (II 0 dt (a is constant)
v — vO =at
v = D0 + at
dx
F , v = —
urther d t
dx = v dt
Integrating both sides

J:dx=I;vdt

x = x0+v0 t+§at

We can write

or,vdv=adx

 

Integrating both sides,

v2 =v§ +2a(x—x0)

The advantage of this method is that it can be
used for motion with non-uniform acceleration
also.

Now, we shall use these equations to some
important cases. 4

 

Example 3.4 A ball is thrown vertically
upwards with a velocity of 20 In S‘1 from
the top of a multistorey building. The
height of the point from where the ball is
thrown is 25.0 m from the ground. (a) How
high will the ball rise ‘? and (b) how long
will it be before the ball hits the ground?
Take g =10 m s‘2.

 

Answer (a) Let us take the y-axis in the
vertically upward direction with zero at the
ground, as shown in Fig. 3.13.
Now v0: + 20 m 8—1,
a = —g=—lOmS'2,
v = O m S‘1
If the ball rises to height y from the point of

launch, then using the equation
v2: v§+2 a (y—yo)

we get
0 = (20? + 2(—10)(y — yo)
Solving, we get, (y — yo) = 20 m.

(b) We can solve this part of the problem in two
ways. Note carefully the methods used.
