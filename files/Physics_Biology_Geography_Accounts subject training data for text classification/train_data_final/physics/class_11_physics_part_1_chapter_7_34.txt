From the results obtained it is clear that among
the three bodies the sphere has the greatest and
the ring has the least velocity of the centre of mass
at the bottom of the inclined plane.

Suppose the bodies have the same mass. Which
body has the greatest rotational ldnetic energy while

SUMMARY

1. Ideally, a rigid body is one for which the distances between different particles of the
body do not change, even though there are forces on them.

2. A rigid body fixed at one point or along a line can have only rotational motion. A rigid
body not fixed in some way can have either pure translational motion or a combination
of translational and rotational motions.

3. In rotation about a fixed axis, every particle of the rigid body moves in a circle which
lies in a plane perpendicular to the axis and has its centre on the axis. Every Point in
the rotating rigid body has the same angular velocity at any instant of time.

4. In pure translation, every particle of the body moves with the same velocity at any
instant of time.

5. Angular velocity is a vector. Its magnitude is a) = dG/dt and it is directed along the axis
of rotation. For rotation about a fixed axis, this vector a) has a fixed direction.
