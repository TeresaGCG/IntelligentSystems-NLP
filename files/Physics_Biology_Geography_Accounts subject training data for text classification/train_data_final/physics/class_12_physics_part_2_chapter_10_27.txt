P1 transmits nearly the full intensity emerging from P2 (Fig. 10.22).

FIGURE 10.22 (a) Passage of light through two polaroids P2 and PI. The
transmitted fraction falls from 1 to 0 as the angle between them varies
from 0° to 90°. Notice that the light seen through a single polaroid
Pl does not vary with angle. (b) Behaviour of the electric vector
when light passes through two polaroids. The transmitted

polarisation is the component parallel to the polaroid axis.
The double arrows show the oscillations of the electric vector.

The above experiment can be easily understood by assuming that
light passing through the polaroid P2 gets polarised along the pass-axis
of P2. If the pass-axis of P2 makes an angle 0 with the pass-axis of P1,
then when the polarised beam passes through the polaroid P2, the
component E cos 0 (along the pass-axis of P2) will pass through P2.
Thus, as we rotate the polaroid P1 (or P2), the intensity will vary as:

1= 10 cos26 (10.35)

where I0 is the intensity of the polarized light after passing through
P1. This is known as Malus’ law. The above discussion shows that the
intensity coming out of a single polaroid is half of the incident intensity.
By putting a second polaroid, the intensity can be further controlled
from 50% to zero of the incident intensity by adjusting the angle between
the pass-axes of two polaroids.

Polaroids can be used to control the intensity, in sunglasses,
windowpanes, etc. Polaroids are also used in photographic cameras and
3D movie cameras.

Example 10.8 Discuss the intensity of transmitted light when a
polaroid sheet is rotated between two crossed polaroids?

Solution Let IO be the intensity of polarised light after passing through
the first polariser P1. Then the intensity of light after passing through
second polariser P2 will be

I = Iocoszﬁ,
