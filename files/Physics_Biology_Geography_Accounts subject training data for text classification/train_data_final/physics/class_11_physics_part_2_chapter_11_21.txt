POINTS TO PONDER
1. The relation connecting Kelvin temperature (T) and the Celsius temperature tC

T = to + 273.15

and the assignment T = 273.16 K for the triple point of water are exact relations (by
choice). With this choice, the Celsius temperature of the melting point of water and
boiling point of water (both at 1 atm pressure) are very close to, but not exactly equal
to 0 °C and 100 °C respectively. In the original Celsius scale, these latter ﬁxed points
were exactly at 0 °C and 100 °C (by choice), but now the triple point of water is the
preferred choice for the ﬁxed point, because it has a unique temperature.

A liquid in equilibrium with vapour has the same pressure and temperature throughout
the system; the two phases in equilibrium differ in their molar volume [i.e. density).
This is true for a system with any number of phases in equilibrium.

Heat transfer always involves temperature difference between two systems or two parts
of the same system. Any energy transfer that does not involve temperature difference
in some way is not heat.

Convection involves ﬂow of matter within a ﬂuid due to unequal temperatures of its
parts. A hot bar placed under a running tap loses heat by conduction between the
surface of the bar and water and not by convection within water.
