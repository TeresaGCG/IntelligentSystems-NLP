MOTION IN A PLANE

aC = [R] v = v2/R (4.44)

Thus, the acceleration of an object moving with
speed 1) in a circle of radius R has a magnitude

v2 / R and is always directed towards the centre.
This is why this acceleration is called centripetal
acceleration (a term proposed by Newton). A
thorough analysis of centripetal acceleration was
first published in 1673 by the Dutch scientist
Christiaan Huygens (1629-1695) but it was
probably known to Newton also some years earlier.
“Cent1ipetal” comes ﬁom a Greek term which means
‘centre-seeln‘ng’. Since 1) and R are constant, the
magnitude of the centripetal acceleration is also
constant. However, the direction changes —
pointing always towards the centre. Therefore, a
centripetal acceleration is not a constant vector.

We have another way of describing the
velocity and the acceleration of an object in
uniform circular motion. As the object moves
from P to P’ in time At (= t’ — t), the line CP
(Fig. 4.19) turns through an angle A0 as shown
in the figure. A0 is called angular distance. We
define the angular speed a) (Greek letter omega)
as the time rate of change of angular
displacement :

w: _
At (4.45)

Now, if the distance travelled by the object
during the time At is As, i.e. PP’is As, then :

As
v = —
At
but As = R A6. Therefore :
A6
1) = R— = R a)
At
v = R a) (4.46)

We can express centripetal acceleration aC in
terms of angular speed :

v2 (02R2 2
aC = — = — = a) R
R R
a =sz (4.47)

The time taken by an object to make one revolution
is known as its time period Tand the number of
revolution made in one second is called its
frequency v (= 1 / T). However, during this time the
distance moved by the object is s = 27rR.

Therefore, 1) = 27cR/ T =27ch (4.48)
In terms of frequency v, we have
a) = 27w
v = 275Rv
ac = 47:2 v2R (4.49)

 

} Example 4.10 An insect trapped in a
circular groove of radius 12 cm moves along
the groove steadily and completes 7
revolutions in 100 s. (a) What is the
angular speed, and the linear speed ol‘the
motion? (b) Is the acceleration vector a
constant vector ? What is its magnitude ’?

 

Answer This is an example of uniform circular
motion. Here R = 12 cm. The angular speed a) is
given by

a) = 2Tc/T= 27: X 7/100 = 0.44 rad/s
The linear speed v is :

v =0) R = 0.44 s1 X 12 cm = 5.3 cm s1

The direction of velocity v is along the tangent
to the circle at every point. The acceleration is
directed towards the centre of the circle. Since
this direction changes continuously,
acceleration here is not a constant vector.
However, the magnitude of acceleration is
constant:

a= a)2 R: (0.44 S'1)2 (12 em)
= 2.3 cm s2 4
