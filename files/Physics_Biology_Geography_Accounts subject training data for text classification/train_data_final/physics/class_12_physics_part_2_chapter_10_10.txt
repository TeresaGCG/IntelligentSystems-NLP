for which

The waves emanating from S1 will arrive exactly two cycles earlier [of]
than the waves from S2 and will again be in phase [Fig 10.9(a)]. Thus, if 32
the displacement produced by S1 is given by

y1 = a cos wt (a)
then the displacement produced by 82 will be given by
Hg = a COS (wt— 4%) = acos wt

where we have used the fact that a path difference of 2)» corresponds to a
phase difference of 47:. The two displacements are once again in phase
and the intensity will again be 4 I0 giving rise to constructive interference.
In the above analysis we have assumed that the distances 819 and 829
are much greater than 01 (which represents the distance between 81 and
82) so that although 819 and 829 are not equal, the amplitudes of the
displacement produced by each wave are very nearly the same. (b)
We next consider a point R [Fig 10.9(b)] for which

The waves emanating from S1 will arrive exactly two and a half cycles interference at a

where we have used the fact that a path difference of 2.5)» corresponds to
a phase difference of 57:. The two displacements are now out of phase
and the two displacements will cancel out to give zero intensity. This is
referred to as destructive interference.

To summarise: If we have two coherent sources S1 and 82 vibrating
in phase, then for an arbitrary point P whenever the path difference,

SIP ~S2P= n2. (n=0, 1,2, 3,...) (1010)

we will have constructive interference and the resultant intensity will be y n = g
410; the sign ~ between SIP and S2 P represents the difference between
SIP and S2 P. On the other hand, if the point P is such that the path
difference,

 

slp ~S2P=(n+%)l (n=0, 1,2,3, ...) (1011)

we will have destructive interference and the resultant intensity will be of points for which
