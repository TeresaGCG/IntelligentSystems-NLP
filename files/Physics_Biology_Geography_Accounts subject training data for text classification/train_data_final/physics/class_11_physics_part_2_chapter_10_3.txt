Fig. 1 0.3 Fluid under gravity. The effect of gravity is
illustrated through pressure on a vertical
cylindrical column.

Pressure difference depends on the vertical
distance h between the points (1 and 2), mass
density of the ﬂuid p and acceleration due to
gravity 9. If the point 1 under discussion is
shifted to the top of the ﬂuid (say, water), which
is open to the atmosphere, P1 may be replaced
by atmospheric pressure (Pa) and we replace P2
by P. Then Eq. (10.6) gives

P=Pa+pgh (10.7)

Thus, the pressure P, at depth below the
surface of a liquid open to the atmosphere is
greater than atmospheric pressure by an
amount pgh. The excess of pressure, P —Pa, at
depth h is called a gauge pressure at that point.

The area of the cylinder is not appearing in
the expression of absolute pressure in Eq. (10.7 ).
Thus, the height of the ﬂuid column is important
and not cross-sectional or base area or the shape
of the container. The liquid pressure is the same
at all points at the same horizontal level (same
depth). The result is appreciated through the
example of hydrostatic paradox. Consider three
vessels A, B and C [Fig.10.4] of different shapes.
They are connected at the bottom by a horizontal
pipe. On filling with water, the level in the three
vessels is the same, though they hold different
amounts of water. This is so because water at
the bottom has the same pressure below each
section of the vessel.

three vessels A, B and C contain different
amounts of liquids, all upto the same
height.

Example 10.2 What is the pressure on a
swimmer 10 m below the surface ofa lake?

Answer Here
h = 10 m andp = 1000 kg m'3. Take g = 10 m s-2
From Eq. (10.7)

P = Pa + p gh

= 1.01 x 105 Pa+ 1000kgm*3 x 10 ms—2 >< 10m

= 2.01 x 105 Pa

z 2 atm

This is a 100% increase in pressure from
surface level. At a depth of 1 km, the increase
in pressure is 100 atm! Submarines are designed
to withstand such enormous pressures. 4

10.2.3 Atmospheric Pressure and
Gauge Pressure

The pressure of the atmosphere at any point is
equal to the weight of a column of air of unit
cross-sectional area extending from that point
to the top of the atmosphere. At sea level, it is
1.0 13 x 105 Pa (1 atm). Italian scientist
Evangelista Torricelli (1608—1647) devised for
the first time a method for measuring
atmospheric pressure. A long glass tube closed
at one end and filled with mercury is inverted
into a trough of mercury as shown in Fig. 10.5 (a).
This device is known as ‘mercury barometer’.
The space above the mercury column in the tube
contains only mercury vapour whose pressure
P is so small that it may be neglected. Thus,
the pressure at Point A=0. The pressure inside
the coloumn at Point B must be the same as the
pressure at Point C, which is atmospheric
pressure, Pa.

Pa = p gh (10.8)
where p is the density of mercury and h is the
height of the mercury column in the tube.
