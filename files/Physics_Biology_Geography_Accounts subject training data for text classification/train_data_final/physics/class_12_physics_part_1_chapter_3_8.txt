3.6 LIMITATIONS 0F OHM’S LAW

Although Ohm’s law has been found valid over a large class
of materials, there do exist materials and devices used in

 

 

electric circuits where the proportionality of Vand I does not
hold. The deviations broadly are one or more of the following
types:

(a) Vceases to be proportional to I (Fig. 3.5).

(b) The relation between Vand I depends on the sign of V. In

other words, if I is the current for a certain V, then reversing conductor.
the direction of V keeping its magnitude fixed, does not

produce a current of the same magnitude as I in the opposite direction

(Fig. 3.6). This happens, for example, in a diode which we will study

in Chapter 14.

scales for negative and positive
values of the voltage and current.

(c) The relation between Vand I is not unique, i.e., there is more than
one value of Vfor the same current I (Fig. 3.7). A material exhibiting
such behaviour is GaAs.

Materials and devices not obeying Ohm’s law in the form of Eq. (3.3)
are actually widely used in electronic circuits. In this and a few
subsequent chapters, however, we will study the electrical currents in
materials that obey Ohm’s law.
