Andre Ampere (1775 -
1836) Andre Marie Ampere
was a French physicist,
mathematician and chemist
who founded the science of
electrodynamics. Ampere
was a child prodigy
who mastered advanced
mathematics by the age of
12. Ampere grasped the
significance of Oersted’s
discovery. He carried out a
large series of experiments
to explore the relationship
between current electricity
and magnetism. These
investigations culminated
in 1827 with the
publication of the
‘Mathematical Theory of
Electrodynamic Pheno-
mena Deduced Solely from
Experiments’. He‘ hypo-
thesised that all magnetic
phenomena are due to

circulating electric
currents. Ampere was
humble and absent-

minded. He once forgot an
invitation to dine with the
Emperor Napoleon. He died
of pneumonia at the age of
61. His gravestone bears
the epitaph: Tandem Felix
(Happy at last).

 

 

(i) B is tangential to the loop and is a non-zero constant
B, or

(ii) B is normal to the loop, or

(iii) B vanishes.

Now, let Lbe the length (part) of the loop for which B
is tangential. Let 18 be the current enclosed by the loop.
Then, Eq. (4.1 7) reduces to,

BL =p018 [4.17(b)]

When there is a system with a symmetry such as for
a straight inﬁnite current-carrying wire in Fig. 4.15, the
Ampere’s law enables an easy evaluation of the magnetic
field, much the same way Gauss’ law helps in
determination of the electric ﬁeld. This is exhibited in the
Example 4.9 below. The boundary of the loop chosen is
a circle and magnetic field is tangential to the
circumference of the circle. The law gives, for the left hand
side of Eq. [4.17 (b)], B. 2m. We find that the magnetic
field at a distance r outside the wire is tangential and
given by

BX 2m = #01,

B = a0 1/ (2m) (4.18)

The above result for the inﬁnite wire is interesting
from several points of View.

(i) It implies that the field at every point on a circle of
radius r, (with the wire along the axis), is same in
magnitude. In other words, the magnetic field
possesses what is called a cylindrical symmetry. The
field that normally can depend on three coordinates
depends only on one: r. Whenever there is symmetry,
the solutions simplify.

(ii) The field direction at any point on this circle is
tangential to it. Thus, the lines of constant magnitude
of magnetic ﬁeld form concentric circles. Notice now,
in Fig. 4. 1 (c), the iron ﬁlings form concentric circles.
These lines called magnetic ﬁeld lines form closed
loops. This is unlike the electrostatic ﬁeld lines which
originate from positive charges and end at negative
charges. The expression for the magnetic ﬁeld of a
straight wire provides a theoretical justiﬁcation to
Oersted’s experiments.

(iii) Another interesting point to note is that even though
the wire is inﬁnite, the ﬁeld due to it at a non-zero
distance is not infinite. It tends to blow up only when
we come very close to the wire. The ﬁeld is directly
proportional to the current and inversely proportional
to the distance from the (infinitely long) current
source.
