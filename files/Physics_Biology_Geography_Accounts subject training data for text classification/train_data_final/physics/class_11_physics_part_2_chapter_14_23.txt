The motion of a particle executing simple harmonic motion is described by the
displacement function,

x(t] = A cos [cot+ (1)].

If the initial [t = 0) position of the particle is 1 cm and its initial velocity is (0 cm/ s,
what are its amplitude and initial phase angle ? The angular frequency of the
particle is 7r. 5*. If instead of the cosine function, we choose the sine function to
describe the SHM : x = B sin (wt + a), what are the amplitude and initial phase of the
particle with the above initial conditions.

A spring balance has a scale that reads from 0 to 50 kg. The length of the scale is 20
cm. Abody suspended from this balance, when displaced and released, oscillates
with a period of 0.6 s. What is the weight of the body ?

A spring having with a spring constant 1200 N m’1 is mounted on a horizontal
table as shown in Fig. 14.24. A mass of 3 kg is attached to the free end of the

spring. The mass is then pulled sideways to a distance of 2.0 cm and released.

Determine [i] the frequency of oscillations, [ii] maximum acceleration of the mass,
and [iii] the maximum speed of the mass.

In Exercise 14.9, let us take the position of mass when the spring is unstreched as
x = 0, and the direction from left to right as the positive direction of
x—axis. Give x as a function of time t for the oscillating mass if at the moment we
start the stopwatch [t = 0], the mass is

(a) at the mean position,

[b] at the maximum stretched position, and

[c] at the maximum compressed position.

In what way do these functions for SHM differ from each other, in frequency, in
amplitude or the initial phase?

Figures 14.25 correspond to two circular motions. The radius of the circle, the
period of revolution, the initial position, and the sense of revolution (i.e. clockwise
or anti—clockwise) are indicated on each figure.

Obtain the corresponding simple harmonic motions of the x—projection of the radius
vector of the revolving particle P, in each case.

Plot the corresponding reference circle for each of the following simple harmonic
motions. Indicate the initial [t =0) position of the particle, the radius of the circle,
