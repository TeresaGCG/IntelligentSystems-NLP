Its mass is volume X density = 7.9 g cm‘3 X 10‘12 cm3= 7.9 X 10’12 g
It is given that Avagadro number (6.023 X 1023) of iron atoms have a
mass of 55 g. Hence, the number of atoms in the domain is

7.9 x 10“12 x 6.023 x 1023
55
= 8.65 X 1010 atoms

N:

The maximum possible dipole moment m is achieved for the

max

(unrealistic) case when all the atomic moments are perfectly aligned.

Thus,

mm: (8.65 x 1010) x (9.27 x 10-24)
= 8.0 x 10‘13 A m2

The consequent magnetisation is

M = mum/Domain volume

max

= 8.0 x 10*13 Am2/ 10-18 m3
= 8.0 x 105 Am‘1

The relation between B and H in ferromagnetic materials is complex.
It is often not linear and it depends on the magnetic history of the sample.
Figure 5.14 depicts the behaviour of the material as we take it through
one cycle of magnetisation. Let the material be unmagnetised initially. We

place it in a solenoid and increase the current through the
solenoid. The magnetic field B in the material rises and
saturates as depicted in the curve 0a. This behaviour
represents the alignment and merger of domains until no
further enhancement is possible. It is pointless to increase
the current (and hence the magnetic intensity H) beyond
this. Next, we decrease H and reduce it to zero. At H = O, B
i O. This is represented by the curve ab. The value of B at
H = O is called retentivity or remanence. In Fig. 5.14, BR ~
1.2 T, where the subscript R denotes retentivity. The
domains are not completely randomised even though the
external driving field has been removed. Next, the current
in the solenoid is reversed and slowly increased. Certain
domains are ﬂipped until the net field inside stands
nulliﬁed. This is represented by the curve bc. The value of
H at c is called coercivity. In Fig. 5.14 HC ~ —90 A m‘l. As
the reversed current is increased in magnitude, we once
again obtain saturation. The curve cd depicts this. The
saturated magnetic ﬁeld BS ~ 1.5 T. Next, the current is
reduced (curve de) and reversed (curve ea). The cycle repeats

itself. Note that the curve Oa does not retrace itself as H is reduced. For a
given value of H, B is not unique but depends on previous history of the
sample. This phenomenon is called hysterisis. The word hysterisis means

lagging behind (and not ‘history’).

5.7 PERMANENT MAGNETS AND ELECTROMAGNETS

Substances which at room temperature retain their ferromagnetic property
for a long period of time are called permanent magnets. Permanent
