James Clerk Maxwell
(1831 - 1879) Born in
Edinburgh, Scotland,
was among the greatest
physicists of the
nineteenth century. He
derived the thermal
velocity distribution of
molecules in a gas and
was among the first to

obtain reliable
estimates of molecular
parameters from

measurable quantities
like viscosity, etc.
Maxwell’s greatest
acheivement was the
uniﬁcation of the? laWS of
electricity and
magnetism (discovered
by Coulomb, Oersted,
Ampere and Faraday)
into a consistent set of
equations now called
Maxwell’s equations.
From these he arrived at
the most important
conclusion that light is
an electromagnetic
wave. Interestingly,
Maxwell did not agree
with the idea (strongly
suggested by the
Faraday’s laws of
electrolysis) that
electricity was
particulate in nature.

 

 

the speed of light( 3 X 108 m/s), obtained from optical
measurements. This led to the remarkable conclusion
that light is an electromagnetic wave. Maxwell’s work
thus unified the domain of electricity, magnetism and
light. Hertz, in 1885, experimentally demonstrated the
existence of electromagnetic waves. Its technological use
by Marconi and others led in due course to the
revolution in communication that we are witnessing
today.

In this chapter, we first discuss the need for
displacement current and its consequences. Then we
present a descriptive account of electromagnetic waves.
The broad spectrum of electromagnetic waves,
stretching from y rays (wavelength ~10‘12 m) to long
radio waves (wavelength ~ 106 m) is described. How the
electromagnetic waves are sent and received for
communication is discussed in Chapter 1 5.

8.2 DISPLACEMENT CURRENT

We have seen in Chapter 4 that an electrical current
produces a magnetic ﬁeld around it. Maxwell showed
that for logical consistency, a changing electric ﬁeld must
also produce a magnetic ﬁeld. This effect is of great
importance because it explains the existence of radio
waves, gamma rays and visible light, as well as all other
forms of electromagnetic waves.

To see how a changing electric ﬁeld gives rise to
a magnetic field, let us consider the process of
charging of a capacitor and apply Ampere’s circuital
law given by (Chapter 4)

§B~dl = #0 i (t) (8.1)

to ﬁnd magnetic ﬁeld at a point outside the capacitor.
Figure 8. 1 (a) shows a parallel plate capacitor C which
is a part of circuit through which a time-dependent
current i (t) ﬂows . Let us ﬁnd the magnetic field at a
point such as P, in a region outside the parallel plate
capacitor. For this, we consider a plane circular loop of
radius rwhose plane is perpendicular to the direction
of the current-carrying Wire, and which is centred
symmetrically with respect to the wire [Fig. 8.1(a)]. From
symmetry, the magnetic ﬁeld is directed along the
circumference of the circular loop and is the same in
magnitude at all points on the loop so that if B is the
magnitude of the ﬁeld, the left side of Eq. (8.1) is B (27: r).
So we have

B (2117) = ,uoi (t) (8 .2)
