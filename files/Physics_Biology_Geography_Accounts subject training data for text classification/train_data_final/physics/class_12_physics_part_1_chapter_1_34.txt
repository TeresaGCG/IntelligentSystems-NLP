Electric Charges
and Fields

 

(iv) The surface that we choose for the application of Gauss’s law is called
the Gaussian surface. You may choose any Gaussian surface and
apply Gauss’s law. However, take care not to let the Gaussian surface
pass through any discrete charge. This is because electric field due
to a system of discrete charges is not well defined at the location of
any charge. (As you go close to the charge, the field grows without
any bound.) However, the Gaussian surface can pass through a
continuous charge distribution.

(V) Gauss’s law is often useful towards a much easier calculation of the
electrostatic field when the system has some symmetry. This is
facilitated by the choice of a suitable Gaussian surface.

(vi) Finally, Gauss’s law is based on the inverse square dependence on
distance contained in the Coulomb’s law. Any violation of Gauss’s
law will indicate departure from the inverse square law.

Example 1.11 The electric field components in Fig 1. 27 are
Ex=ou<,1/2 Ey = E2 = O, in which a: 800 N/C ml/Z. Calculate (a) the
ﬂux throughy the cube and (b) the charge within the cube Assume
that a= O. 1 m.

Solution

(a) Since the electric field has only an x component, for faces
perpendicular to x direction, the angle between E and AS is
i n/ 2. Therefore, the ﬂux g1) = E.AS is separately zero for each face
of the cube except the two shaded ones. Now the magnitude of
the electric field at the left face is
EL = axl/Z = aal/Z
(x = a at the left face).
The magnitude of electric field at the right face is
ER = 05x”2 = o:(2a)1/2
(x = 2a at the right face).
The corresponding ﬂuxes are

¢L= EL-AS = ASEL -ﬁL =EL AS 0089 = —EL AS, since 9 = 180°
= —ELa2

¢R= ER-AS = ER AS 0080 = ER AS, since 9 = 0°
= ERa2
