12.3. 1 Spectral series

We might expect that the frequencies of the light emitted by a particular
element would exhibit some regular pattern. Hydrogen is the simplest
atom and therefore, has the simplest spectrum. In the observed spectrum,
however, at ﬁrst sight, there does not seem to be
any resemblance of order or regularity in spectral
lines. But the spacing between lines within certain
sets of the hydrogen spectrum decreases in a

regular way (Fig. 12.5). Each of these sets is called
a spectral series. In 1885, the first such series was
observed by a Swedish school teacher Johann Jakob
Balmer (1825—1898) in the visible region of the
hydrogen spectrum. This series is called Balmer

where 2. is the wavelength, R is a constant called the Rydberg constant,
and nmay have integral values 3, 4, 5, etc. The value of R is 1.097 X 107 m‘l.
This equation is also called Balmer formula.

Taking n = 3 in Eq. (12.5), one obtains the wavelength of the H0‘ line:
