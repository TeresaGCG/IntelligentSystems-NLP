Electrostatic Potential
and Capacitance

 

2.9 Explain what would happen if in the capacitor given in Exercise
2.8, a 3 mm thick mica sheet (of dielectric constant = 6) were inserted
between the plates,

(a) while the voltage supply remained connected.
(b) after the supply was disconnected.

2.10 A 12pF capacitor is connected to a 50V battery. How much
electrostatic energy is stored in the capacitor?

2.11 A 600pF capacitor is charged by a 200V supply. It is then
disconnected from the supply and is connected to another
uncharged 600 pF capacitor. How much electrostatic energy is lost
in the process?

2. 12 A charge of 8 mC is located at the origin. Calculate the work done in
taking a small charge of —2 X 10’9 C from a point P (O, O, 3 cm) to a
point Q (0, 4 cm, 0), via a point R (O, 6 cm, 9 cm).

2. 13 A cube of side b has a charge q at each of its vertices. Determine the
potential and electric field due to this charge array at the centre of
the cube.

2.14 Two tiny spheres carrying charges 1.5 11C and 2.5 uC are located 30 cm
apart. Find the potential and electric ﬁeld:

(a) at the mid-point of the line joining the two charges, and

(b) at a point 10 cm from this midpoint in a plane normal to the
line and passing through the mid-point.

2.15 A spherical conducting shell of inner radius r1 and outer radius r2
has a charge Q.

(a) A charge q is placed at the centre of the shell. What is the
surface charge density on the inner and outer surfaces of the

shell?

(b) Is the electric field inside a cavity (with no charge) zero, even if
the shell is not spherical, but has any irregular shape? Explain.

2.16 (a) Show that the normal component of electrostatic field has a
discontinuity from one side of a charged surface to another
given by

(EZ—E1)-ﬁ= 3

where 11 is a unit vector normal to the surface at a point and
a is the surface charge density at that point. (T he direction of

n is from side 1 to side 2.) Hence, show that just outside a
conductor, the electric field is 0 f1 /80.
