Electromagnetic
Induction

 

even if the charges are stationary [and the q (v X B) term of the Lorentz
force is not operative], an emf is nevertheless induced in the presence of a
time-varying magnetic ﬁeld. Thus, moving charges in static field and static
charges in a time-varying field seem to be symmetric situation for
Faraday’s law. This gives a tantalising hint on the relevance of the principle
of relativity for Faraday’s law.

4. The motion of a copper plate is damped when it is allowed to oscillate
between the magnetic pole-pieces. How is the damping force, produced by
the eddy currents?
