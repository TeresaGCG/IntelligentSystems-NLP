F Example 4.1 Rain is falling vertically with
a speed of 35 m 5‘1. Winds starts blowing
after sometime with a speed of 12 m S'1 in
east to west direction. In which direction

Answer The velocity of the rain and the wind
are represented by the vectors vr and vw in Fig.
4.7 and are in the direction specified by the
problem. Using the rule of vector addition, we
see that the resultant of vr and vW is R as shown
in the figure. The magnitude of R is

R: vr2+vi =\/352+122 ms_1=37ms_1

The direction 0 that R makes with the vertical
is given by

Or, a = tan'1(0.343) = 19°
Therefore, the boy should hold his umbrella

in the vertical plane at an angle of about 19°
with the vertical towards the east. 4

4.5 RESOLUTION OF VECTORS

Let a and b be any two non-zero vectors in a
plane with different directions and let A be
another vector in the same plane(Fig. 4.8). A can
be expressed as a sum of two vectors — one
obtained by multiplying a by a real number and
the other obtained by multiplying b by another
real number. To see this, let 0 and P be the tail
and head of the vector A. Then, through 0, draw
a straight line parallel to a, and through P, a
straight line parallel to b. Let them intersect at
Q. Then, we have

A = or = 09 + QP (4.6)

But since 09 is parallel to a, and QP is parallel
to b, we can write :

OQ =/la, and QP= ub (4.7)
where /’L and u are real numbers.
Therefore, A = )l a + ub (4.8)

We say that A has been resolved into two
component vectors /’L a and u b along a and b
respectively. Using this method one can resolve
