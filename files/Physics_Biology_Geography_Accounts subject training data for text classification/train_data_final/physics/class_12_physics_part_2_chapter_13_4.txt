Example 13.1 Given the mass of iron nucleus as 55.85u and A=56,
find the nuclear density?

Solution
mFe = 5585, u = 9.27 x 10‘26 kg
mass 9.27><10'26 x 1
volume ' (41c/3)(1.2><10‘15)3 56
= 2.29 x 1017 kg m“3
The density of matter in neutron stars (an astrophysical object) is
comparable to this density. This shows that matter in these objects

has been compressed to such an extent that they resemble a big nucleus.

 

Nuclear density =

13.4 MASS-ENERGY AND NUCLEAR BINDING ENERGY
13.4.1 Mass - Energy

Einstein showed from his theory of special relativity that it is necessary
to treat mass as another form of energy. Before the advent of this theory
of special relativity it was presumed that mass and energy were conserved
separately in a reaction. However, Einstein showed that mass is another
form of energy and one can convert mass-energy into other forms of
energy, say kinetic energy and vice-versa.

Einstein gave the famous mass-energy equivalence relation
E = mc2 (13.6)

Here the energy equivalent of mass m is related by the above equation

and c is the velocity of light in vacuum and is approximately equal to
3X 108 m s‘l.

Example 13.2 Calculate the energy equivalent of 1 g of substance.

Solution
Energy, E= 10“3 x (3 x 108)2J

E= 10‘3x 9 x 1016: 9 x 1013.1
Thus, if one gram of matter is converted to energy, there is a release
of enormous amount of energy.

Experimental verification of the Einstein’s mass-energy relation has
been achieved in the study of nuclear reactions amongst nucleons, nuclei,
electrons and other more recently discovered particles. In a reaction the
conservation law of energy states that the initial energy and the ﬁnal
energy are equal provided the energy associated with mass is also
included. This concept is important in understanding nuclear masses
and the interaction of nuclei with one another. They form the subject
matter of the next few sections.

13.4.2 Nuclear binding energy

In Section 13.2 we have seen that the nucleus is made up of neutrons
and protons. Therefore it may be expected that the mass of the nucleus
is equal to the total mass of its individual protons and neutrons. However,
