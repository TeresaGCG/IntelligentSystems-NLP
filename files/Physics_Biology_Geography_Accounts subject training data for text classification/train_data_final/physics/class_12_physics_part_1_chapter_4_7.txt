Moving Charges and
Magnetism

Example 4.3 What is the radius of the path of an electron (mass
9 X 10‘31 kg and charge 1.6 X 10‘19 C) moving at a speed of3 X107 m/s in
a magnetic field of 6 X 10;4 T perpendicular to it? What is its
frequency? Calculate its energy in keV. ( 1 eV = 1.6 X 10!19 J).

Solution Using Eq. (4.5) we find
r = mv/ (qB) =9x1oz31kgx3x 107 ms’1 /(1.6X 1049c X6X 10‘4T)
=26X 10C2m=26cm
v = v / (2 m) = 2x106 s’1 = 2x106 Hz =2 MHz.
= (1/2 )mv2 = (1/2) 9 x 104”1 kg x 9 x 1014 111%2 = 40.5 x10z17 J
z 4X10’16J = 2.5 keV.

HELICAL MOTION OF CHARGED PARTICLES AND AURORA BOREALIS

In polar regions like Alaska and Northern Canada, a splendid display of colours is seen
in the sky. The appearance of dancing green pink lights is fascinating, and equally
puzzling. An explanation of this natural phenomenon is now found in physics, in terms
of what we have studied here.

Consider a charged particle of mass m and charge q, entering a region of magnetic
ﬁeld B with an initial velocity v. Let this velocity have a component VP parallel to the
magnetic ﬁeld and a component v11 normal to it. There is no force on a charged particle in
the direction of the ﬁeld. Hence the particle continues to travel with the velocity VP parallel
to the field. The normal component vn of the particle results in a Lorentz force (vn X B)
which 1s perpendicular to both v11 and B. As seen in Section 4.3.1 the particle thus has a
tendency to perform a circular motion in a plane perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld.
When this is coupled With the velocity parallel to the ﬁeld, the resulting trajectory will be
a helix along the magnetic field line, as shown in Figure (a) here. Even if the ﬁeld line
bends, the helically moving particle is trapped and guided to move around the ﬁeld line.
Since the Lorentz force is normal to the velocity of each point, the ﬁeld does no work on
the particle and the magnitude of velocity remains the same.

During a solar ﬂare, a large number of electrons and protons are ejected from the sun.
Some of them get trapped in the earth’s magnetic ﬁeld and move in helical paths along the
ﬁeld lines. The ﬁeld lines come closer to each other near the magnetic poles; see ﬁgure (b).
Hence the density of charges increases near the poles. These particles collide with atoms
and molecules of the atmosphere. Excited oxygen atoms emit green light and excited
nitrogen atoms emits pink light. This phenomenon is called Aurora Borealis in physics.
