Torques of equal magnitude are applied to a hollow cylinder and a solid sphere, both
having the same mass and radius. The cylinder is free to rotate about its standard
axis of symmetry, and the sphere is free to rotate about an axis passing through its
centre. Which of the two will acquire a greater angular speed after a given time.

A solid cylinder of mass 20 kg rotates about its axis with angular speed 100 rad S" 1.
The radius of the cylinder is 0.25 m. What is the kinetic energy associated with the
rotation of the cylinder? What is the magnitude of angular momentum of the cylinder
about its axis?

[a] A child stands at the centre of a turntable with his two arms outstretched. The
turntable is set rotating with an angular speed of 40 rev/ min. How much is the
angular speed of the child if he folds his hands back and thereby reduces his
moment of inertia to 2/5 times the initial value ? Assume that the turntable
rotates without friction.

[b] Show that the child’s new kinetic energy of rotation is more than the initial
kinetic energy of rotation. How do you account for this increase in kinetic energy?

A rope of negligible mass is wound round a hollow cylinder of mass 3 kg and radius
40 cm. What is the angular acceleration of the cylinder if the rope is pulled with a
force of 30 N ? What is the linear acceleration of the rope ? Assume that there is no
slipping.

To maintain a rotor at a uniform angular speed of 200 rad s‘l, an engine needs to
transmit a torque of 180 N m. What is the power required by the engine ?
(Note: uniform angular velocity in the absence of friction implies zero torque. In
practice, applied torque is needed to counter frictional torque). Assume that the
engine is 100% efficient.

From a uniform disk of radius R, a circular hole of radius R/ 2 is cut out. The centre
of the hole is at R/ 2 from the centre of the original disc. Locate the centre of gravity
of the resulting ﬂat body.

A metre stick is balanced on a knife edge at its centre. When two coins, each of mass
5 g are put one on top of the other at the 12.0 cm mark, the stick is found to be
balanced at 45.0 cm. What is the mass of the metre stick?

A solid sphere rolls down two different inclined planes of the same heights but
different angles of inclination. (a) Will it reach the bottom with the same speed in
each case? [b] Will it take longer to roll down one plane than the other? [c] If so,
which one and why?

A hoop of radius 2 m weighs 100 kg. It rolls along a horizontal ﬂoor so that its centre
of mass has a speed of 20 cm/s. How much work has to be done to stop it?

The oxygen molecule has a mass of 5.30 X 10’26 kg and a moment of inertia of
1.94><10’46 kg m2 about an axis through its centre perpendicular to the lines joining
the two atoms. Suppose the mean speed of such a molecule in a gas is 500 m / s and
that its kinetic energy of rotation is two thirds of its kinetic energy of translation.
Find the average angular velocity of the molecule.

A solid cylinder rolls up an inclined plane of angle of inclination 30°. At the bottom
of the inclined plane the centre of mass of the cylinder has a speed of 5 m / s.

[a] How far will the cylinder go up the plane?

(b) How long will it take to return to the bottom?

As shown in Fig.7.40, the two sides of a step ladder BA and CA are 1.6 m long and
hinged at A. A rope DE, 0.5 m is tied half way up. A weight 40 kg is suspended from
a point F, 1.2 m from B along the ladder BA. Assuming the ﬂoor to be frictionless
and neglecting the weight of the ladder, find the tension in the rope and forces
exerted by the ﬂoor on the ladder. (Take 9 = 9.8 m/s2)

(Hint: Consider the equilibrium of each side of the ladder separately.)
