The damping force depends on the nature of
the surrounding medium. If the block is
immersed in a liquid, the magnitude of damping
will be much greater and the dissipation of
energy much faster. The damping force is
generally proportional to velocity of the bob.
[Remember Stokes’ Law, Eq. (10.19)] and acts
opposite to the direction of velocity. If the
damping force is denoted by F d, we have

Fd =—bv (1430)

where the positive constant b depends on
characteristics of the medium (viscosity, for
example) and the size and shape of the block,
etc. Eq. (14.30) is usually valid only for small
velocity.

When the mass m is attached to the spring
(hung vertically as shown in Fig. 14.19) and
released, the spring will elongate a little and the
mass will settle at some height. This position,
shown by O in Fig 14.19, is the equilibrium
position of the mass. If the mass is pulled down
or pushed up a little, the restoring force on the
block due to the spring is FS = —kx, where x is
the displacement* of the mass from its
equilibrium position. Thus, the total force acting
on the mass at any time t, is F = 40: —bv.

If a(t) is the acceleration of mass at time t,
then by Newton’s Law of Motion applied along
the direction of motion, we have

m a(t) = —k x(t) — b v(t) (14.31)

Here we have dropped the vector notation
because we are discussing one-dimensional
motion.

Using the first and second derivatives of x (t)
for v (t) and a (t), respectively, we have

The solution of Eq. (14.32) describes the
motion of the block under the inﬂuence of a
damping force which is proportional to velocity.
The solution is found to be of the form

x(t) = A e‘bt/Zm cos (out + ¢) (14.33)

where A is the amplitude and (0' is the angular

In this function, the cosine function has a
period 27r/a)’ but the function x(t) is not strictly
periodic because of the factor 64’ ”2’” which
decreases continuously with time. However, if the
decrease is small in one time period T, the motion
represented by Eq. (14.33) is approximately
periodic.

The solution, Eq. (14.33), can be graphically
represented as shown in Fig. 14.20. We can
regard it as a cosine function whose amplitude,
which is Aéb ”2m, gradually decreases with time.

Fig. 14.20 A damped oscillator is approximately
periodic with decreasing amplitude of

oscillation. With greater damping,
oscillations die out faster.

Now the mechanical energy of the undamped
oscillator is 1/ 2 kA2. For a damped oscillator,
the amplitude is not constant but depends on
time. For small damping, we may use the same
expression but regard the amplitude as A ebt/Zm

E(t) =% k A2 6%... (14.35)

Equation (14.35) shows that the total energy
of the system decreases exponentially with time.
Note that small damping means that the

* Under gravity, the block will be at a certain equilibrium position 0 on the spring; x here represents the

disp lacement from that position.
