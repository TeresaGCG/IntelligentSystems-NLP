Which of the following functions of time represent [a] simple harmonic, [b] periodic
but not simple harmonic, and [c] non-periodic motion? Give period for each case of
periodic motion [co is any positive constant}:

(a) sin cot— cos cot

(b) sin3 cot

[c] 3 cos [n/4 — 2wt]

(d) cos cot + cos Scot + cos 5wt

[e] exp [—(oztzl

[f] 1 + (at + (02?

A particle is in linear simple harmonic motion between two points, A and B, 10 cm
apart. Take the direction from A to B as the positive direction and give the signs of
velocity, acceleration and force on the particle when it is

[a] at the end A,

(b) at the end B,

[c] at the mid—point of AB going towards A,

(d) at 2 cm away from B going towards A,

[e] at 3 cm away from A going towards B, and

[f] at 4 cm away from B going towards A.

Which of the following relationships between the acceleration a and the displacement
x of a particle involve simple harmonic motion?

(a) a = 0.7x
[b] a = —200x2
[0] = —10x
[d] a = 100x3
