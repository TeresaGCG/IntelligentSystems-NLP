and is determined from the positions of the source charges.

1.8.2 Physical signiﬁcance of electric field

You may wonder why the notion of electric ﬁeld has been introduced
here at all. After all, for any system of charges, the measurable quantity
is the force on a charge which can be directly determined using Coulomb’s
law and the superposition principle [Eq. (1.5)]. Why then introduce this
intermediate quantity called the electric ﬁeld?

For electrostatics, the concept of electric field is convenient, but not
really necessary. Electric field is an elegant way of characterising the
electrical environment of a system of charges. Electric field at a point in
the space around a system of charges tells you the force a unit positive
test charge would experience if placed at that point (without disturbing
the system). Electric ﬁeld is a characteristic of the system of charges and
is independent of the test charge that you place at a point to determine
the ﬁeld. The term ﬁeld in physics generally refers to a quantity that is
deﬁned at every point in space and may vary from point to point. Electric
ﬁeld is a vector ﬁeld, since force is a vector quantity.

The true physical signiﬁcance of the concept of electric ﬁeld, however,
emerges only when we go beyond electrostatics and deal with time-
dependent electromagnetic phenomena. Suppose we consider the force
between two distant charges q1, q2 in accelerated motion. Now the greatest
speed with which a signal or information can go from one point to another
is c, the speed of light. Thus, the effect of any motion of q1 on q2 cannot
