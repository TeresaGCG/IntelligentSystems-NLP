strokes normal to the river current? How far down the river does he go when he
reaches the other bank ?

4. 14 In a harbour, wind is blowing at the speed of 72 km / h and the ﬂag on the mast of a boat
anchored in the harbour ﬂutters along the N—E direction. If the boat starts moving at a
speed of 5 1 km / h to the north, what is the direction of the ﬂag on the mast of the boat ?

4. 15 The ceiling of a long hall is 25 m high. What is the maximum horizontal distance that
a ball thrown with a speed of 40 m s‘1 can go without hitting the ceiling of the hall ?

4. 16 A cricketer can throw a ball to a maximum horizontal distance of 100 m. How much
high above the ground can the cricketer throw the same ball ?

4.17 A stone tied to the end of a string 80 cm long is whirled in a horizontal circle with a
constant speed. If the stone makes 14 revolutions in 25 s, what is the magnitude and
direction of acceleration of the stone ?

4. 18 An aircraft executes a horizontal loop of radius 1.00 km with a steady speed of 900
km / h. Compare its centripetal acceleration with the acceleration due to gravity.

4.19 Read each statement below carefully and state, with reasons, if it is true or false :
(a) The net acceleration of a particle in circular motion is always along the radius of
the circle towards the centre
(b) The velocity vector of a particle at a point is always along the tangent to the path
of the particle at that point
[c] The acceleration vector of a particle in umfom circular motion averaged over one
cycle is a null vector

4.20 The position of a particle is given by

r=3.0ti—2.0t2:i+4.0km
where tis in seconds and the coefficients have the proper units for r to be in metres.

[a] Find the v and a of the particle? (b) What is the magnitude and direction of
velocity of the particle at t = 2.0 s ?

4.21 A particle starts from the origin at t= 0 s with a velocity of 10.0} m/s and moves in

the x—y plane with a constant acceleration of (8.0; + 2.03 m s’2. [a] At what time is

the x— coordinate of the particle 16 m? What is the y—coordinate of the particle at
that time? [b] What is the speed of the particle at the time ?

A

4.22 i and j are unit vectors along x— and y— axis respectively. What is the magnitude

A
o

and direction of the vectors 3+3 and i_ J ? What are the components of a vector

A: 2 3+ 33 along the directions of 3+} and i_j? [You may use graphical method]
4.23 For any arbitrary motion in space, which of the following relations are true :

(a) vaverage = [1/2] [v (ti) + v [all
[b] V average = [ruz] — 111:1] ] /[t2 _ t1)
(CIVIt)=v(0)+at
(d}r(t1= 1' (0] +v [0] t+ (1/2] a t2
tel a .v....g =l v It.) — v (t. )1 /( t, — t1]
[The ‘average’ stands for average of the quantity over the time interval tl to t2]
4.24 Read each statement below carefully and state, with reasons and examples, if it is
true or false :

A scalar quantity is one that

[a] is conserved in a process

(b) can never take negative values

[c] must be dimensionless

[d] does not vary from one point to another in space

[e] has the same value for observers with different orientations of axes.

4.25 An aircraft is ﬂying at a height of 3400 m above the ground. If the angle subtended at
a ground observation point by the aircraft positions 10.0 s apart is 30°, what is the
speed of the aircraft ?
