A man stands on a rotating platform, with his arms stretched horizontally holding a
5 kg weight in each hand. The angular speed of the platform is 30 revolutions per
minute. The man then brings his arms close to his body with the distance of each
weight from the axis Changing from 90cm to 200m. The moment of inertia of the
man together with the platform may be taken to be constant and equal to 7.6 kg m2.
(a) What is his new angular speed? (Neglect friction.)

[b] Is kinetic energy conserved in the process? If not, from where does the change
come about?

A bullet of mass 10 g and speed 500 m/ s is fired into a door and gets embedded
exactly at the centre of the door. The door is 1.0 m wide and weighs 12 kg. It is
hinged at one end and rotates about a vertical axis practically without friction. Find
the angular speed of the door just after the bullet embeds into it.

(Hint: The moment of inertia of the door about the vertical axis at one end is ML2/3.)

Two discs of moments of inertia 11 and I2 about their respective axes (normal to the
disc and passing through the centre], and rotating with angular speeds (01 and cog
are brought into contact face to face with their axes of rotation coincident. (a) What
is the angular speed of the two—disc system? [b] Show that the kinetic energy of the
combined system is less than the sum of the initial kinetic energies of the two discs.
How do you account for this loss in energy? Take (01 7’: (02.

[a] Prove the theorem of perpendicular axes.

[Hint : Square of the distance of a point (x, y] in the x—y plane from an axis through
the origin and perpendicular to the plane is x2+y2).

[b] Prove the theorem of parallel axes.
[Hint : If the centre of mass of a system of n particles is chosen to be the origin

2min = 0).
Prove the result that the velocity v of translation of a rolling body [like a ring, disc,
cylinder or sphere) at the bottom of an inclined plane of a height h is given by

v2 = 2 gh

(1 + k2 / R2 )
using dynamical consideration [i.e. by consideration of forces and torques]. Note k is
the radius of gyration of the body about its symmetry axis, and R is the radius of the
body. The body starts from rest at the top of the plane.

A disc rotating about its axis with angular speed (00 is placed lightly [without any
translational push] on a perfectly frictionless table. The radius of the disc is R. What
