as A = B. Note that in Fig. 4.2(b), vectors A’ and
B’ have the same magnitude but they are not
equal because they have different directions.
Even if we shift B’ parallel to itself so that its tail
9’ coincides with the tail 0’ of A’ , the tip S’ of B’

does not coincide with the tip P’ of A’ .

4.3 MULTIPLICATION OF VECTORS BY REAL
NUMBERS

Multiplying a vector A with a positive number 7L
gives a vector whose magnitude is changed by
the factor 7L but the direction is the same as that
of A :

| MI =7L| Al 1990.

For example, if A is multiplied by 2, the resultant
vector 2A is in the same direction as A and has

amagnitude twice of IAI as shown in Fig. 4.3(a).

Multiplying a vector A by a negative number
4L gives another vector whose direction is
opposite to the direction of A and whose
magnitude is 7L times IAI .

Multiplying a given vector A by negative
numbers, say —1 and —1.5, gives vectors as
shown in Fig 4.3(b).

The factor7tby which avectorAis multiplied
could be a scalar having its own physical
dimension. Then, the dimension of 7L A is the
product of the dimensions of 7L and A. For
example, if we multiply a constant velocity vector
by duration (of time), we get a displacement
vector.

4.4 ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION OF
VECTORS — GRAPHICAL METHOD

As mentioned in section 4.2, vectors, by
definition, obey the triangle law or equivalently,
the parallelogram law of addition. We shall now
describe this law of addition using the graphical
method. Let us consider two vectors A and B that
lie in a plane as shown in Fig. 4.4(a). The lengths
of the line segments representing these vectors
are proportional to the magnitude of the vectors.
To find the sum A + B, we place vector B so that
its tail is at the head of the vector A, as in
Fig. 4.4(b). Then, we join the tail of A to the head
of B. This line 09 represents a vector R, that is,
the sum of the vectors A and B. Since, in this
procedure of vector addition, vectors are
