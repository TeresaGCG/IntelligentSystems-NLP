A point charge of 2.0 ”C is at the centre of a cubic Gaussian
surface 9.0 cm on edge. What is the net electric ﬂux through the
surface?

A point charge causes an electric ﬂux of —1.0 X 103 NmZ/C to pass
through a spherical Gaussian surface of 10.0 cm radius centred on
the charge. (a) If the radius of the Gaussian surface were doubled,
how much ﬂux would pass through the surface? (b) What is the
value of the point charge?

A conducting sphere of radius 10 cm has an unknown charge. If
the electric field 20 cm from the centre of the sphere is 1.5 X 103 N/ C
and points radially inward, what is the net charge on the sphere?

A uniformly charged conducting sphere of 2.4 m diameter has a
surface charge density of 80.0 uC/mz. (a) Find the charge on the
sphere. (b) What is the total electric ﬂux leaving the surface of the
sphere?

An infinite line charge produces a field of 9 X 104 N/ C at a distance
of 2 cm. Calculate the linear charge density.

Two large, thin metal plates are parallel and close to each other. On
their inner faces, the plates have surface charge densities of opposite
signs and of magnitude 17.0 X 10522 C / m2. What is E: (a) in the outer
region of the first plate, (b) in the outer region of the second plate,
and (c) between the plates?

An oil drop of 12 excess electrons is held stationary under a constant
electric field of 2.55 X 104 NC’1 (Millikan’s oil drop experiment). The
density of the oil is 1.26 g cm13. Estimate the radius of the drop.
(9 = 9.81 m s2; 6 = 1.60 X 10’19 C).

Which among the curves shown in Fig. 1.35 cannot possibly
represent electrostatic field lines?
