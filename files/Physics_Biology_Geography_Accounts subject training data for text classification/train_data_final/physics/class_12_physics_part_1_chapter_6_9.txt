where we have used dx/dt = —U which is the speed of the conductor P9.
The induced emf B11) is called motional emf. Thus, we are able to produce
induced emf by moving a conductor instead of varying the magnetic field,
that is, by changing the magnetic ﬂux enclosed by the circuit.

It is also possible to explain the motional emf expression in Eq. (6.5)
by invoking the Lorentz force acting on the free charge carriers of conductor
PQ. Consider any arbitrary charge q in the conductor PQ. When the rod
moves with speed 0, the charge will also be moving with speed 0 in the
magnetic field B. The Lorentz force on this charge is qu in magnitude,
and its direction is towards Q. All charges experience the same force, in
magnitude and direction, irrespective of their position in the rod P9.
The work done in moving the charge from P to Q is,

W = qul

Since emf is the work done per unit charge,

8:—
q

= Blv

This equation gives emf induced across the rod P9 and is identical
to Eq. (6.5). We stress that our presentation is not wholly rigorous. But
it does help us to understand the basis of Faraday’s law when
the conductor is moving in a uniform and time-independent
magnetic field.

On the other hand, it is not obvious how an emf is induced when a
conductor is stationary and the magnetic field is changing — a fact which
Faraday verified by numerous experiments. In the case of a stationary
conductor, the force on its charges is given by

F=q(E+va)=qE (6.6)

since v = 0. Thus, any force on the charge must arise from the electric
ﬁeld term E alone. Therefore, to explain the existence of induced emf or
induced current, we must assume that a time-varying magnetic ﬁeld
generates an electric field. However, we hasten to add that electric fields
produced by static electric charges have properties different from those
produced by time-varying magnetic fields. In Chapter 4, we learnt that
charges in motion (current) can exert force / torque on a stationary magnet.
Conversely, a bar magnet in motion (or more generally, a changing
magnetic field) can exert a force on the stationary charge. This is the
fundamental significance of the Faraday’s discovery. Electricity and
magnetism are related.

Example 6.6 A metallic rod of 1 m length is rotated with a frequency
of 50 rev/s, with one end hinged at the centre and the other end at the
circumference of a circular metallic ring of radius 1 m, about an axis
passing through the centre and perpendicular to the plane of the ring
(Fig. 6.1 1). A constant and uniform magnetic ﬁeld of 1 T parallel to the
axis is present everywhere. What is the emf between the centre and

the metallic ring?
