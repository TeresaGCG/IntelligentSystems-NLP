2.3.3 Range of Lengths

The sizes of the objects we come across in the
universe vary over a very wide range. These may
vary from the size of the order of 10'14 m of the
tiny nucleus of an atom to the size of the order
of 1026 m of the extent of the observable universe.
Table 2.3 gives the range and order of lengths
and sizes of some of these objects.

We also use certain special length units for
short and large lengths. These are

1 fermi = 1 f= 10'15 m
1 angstrom = 1 A = 10'10 m
1 astronomical unit = 1 AU (average distance
of the Sun from the Earth)
= 1.496x 1011 m

1 light year = 1 ly= 9.46 x 1015 m (distance
that light travels with velocity of
3 x 108 m S'1 in 1 year)
1 parsec = 3.08 x 1016 m (Parsec is the
distance at which average radius of earth’s orbit
subtends an angle of 1 arc second)

2.4 MEASUREMENT OF MASS

Mass is a basic property of matter. It does not
depend on the temperature, pressure or location
of the object in space. The SI unit of mass is
kilogram (kg). The prototypes of the International
standard kilogram supplied by the International
Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) are
available in many other laboratories of different
countries. In India, this is available at the
National Physical Laboratory (NPL), New Delhi.

While dealing with atoms and molecules, the
kilogram is an inconvenient unit. In this case,
there is an important standard unit of mass,
called the unified atomic mass unit (u), which
has been established for expressing the mass
of atoms as

1 unified atomic mass unit = 1u
= (1 / 12) of the mass of an atom of carbon- 12
isotope (1: C) including the mass of electrons
= 1.66 X 10—27 kg

Mass of commonly available objects can be
determined by a common balance like the one
used in a grocery shop. Large masses in the
universe like planets, stars, etc., based on
Newton’s law of gravitation can be measured by
using gravitational method (See Chapter 8). For
measurement of small masses of atomic/sub-
atomic particles etc., we make use of mass
spectrograph in which radius of the trajectory
is proportional to the mass of a charged particle
moving in uniform electric and magnetic field.

2.4.1 Range of Masses

The masses of the objects, we come across in
the universe, vary over a very wide range. These
may vary from tiny mass of the order of 10'30 kg
of an electron to the huge mass of about 1055 kg
of the known universe. Table 2.4 gives the range
and order of the typical masses of various
objects.
