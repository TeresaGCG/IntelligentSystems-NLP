Thus we obtain

sin i 01

sinr : 02 (10.3)

 

From the above equation, we get the important result that if r < i (i.e.,
if the ray bends toward the normal), the speed of the light wave in the
second medium (02) will be less then the speed of the light wave in the
first medium (vl). This prediction is opposite to the prediction from the
corpuscular model of light and as later experiments showed, the prediction
of the wave theory is correct. Now, if 0 represents the speed of light in
vacuum, then,

”1 2 _ (10.4)

and

n2 = E (10.5)

are known as the refractive indices of medium 1 and medium 2,
respectively. In terms of the refractive indices, Eq. (10.3) can be
written as

n1 sin i= n2 sin r (10.6)
This is the Snell’s law of refraction. Further, if 11 and 12 denote the
wavelengths of light in medium 1 and medium 2, respectively and if the
distance BC is equal to it 1 then the distance AE will be equal to 7L2 (because

if the crest from B has reached C in time ”F, then the crest from A should
have also reached E in time T); thus,

i _ E _ a

12 AE v2
or

i = ”—2

11 1.2 (10.7)

The above equation implies that when a wave gets refracted into a
denser medium (01 > 02) the wavelength and the speed of propagation
decrease but the frequency v (= v/7») remains the same.

10.3.2 Refraction at a rarer medium

We now consider refraction of a plane wave at a rarer medium, i.e.,
02 > 01- Proceeding in an exactly similar manner we can construct a
refracted wavefront as shown in Fig. 10.5. The angle of refraction
will now be greater than angle of incidence; however, we will still have
n1 sin i= n2 sin r. We define an angle iC by the following equation

 

sin ic = & (10.8)

n1
Thus, if i = iC then sin r = 1 and r = 90°. Obviously, for i> is, there can
not be any refracted wave. The angle iC is known as the critical angle and

356 for all angles of incidence greater than the critical angle, we will not have
