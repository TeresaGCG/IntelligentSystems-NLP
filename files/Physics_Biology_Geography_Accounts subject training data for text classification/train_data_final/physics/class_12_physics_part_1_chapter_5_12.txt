(b) If field lines were entirely confined between two ends of a straight
solenoid, the ﬂux through the cross-section at each end would be
non-zero. But the ﬂux of field B through any closed surface must
always be zero. For a toroid, this difficulty is absent because it
has no ‘ends’.

(c) Gauss’s law of magnetism states that the ﬂux of B through any

closed surface is always zero IS B.As : 0 .

If monopoles existed, the right hand side would be equal to the
monopole (magnetic charge) qm enclosed by S. [Analogous to

Gauss’s law of electrostatics, [SEAS = ,qum where qm is the

(monopole) magnetic charge enclosed by S.)

(d) No. There is no force or torque on an element due to the field
produced by that element itself. But there is a force (or torque) on
an element of the same wire. (For the special case of a straight
wire, this force is zero.)

(e) Yes. The average of the charge in the system may be zero. Yet, the
mean of the magnetic moments due to various current loops may
not be zero. We will come across such examples in connection
with paramagnetic material where atoms have net dipole moment

through their net charge is zero.

5.4 THE EARTH’S MAGNETISM

Earlier we have referred to the magnetic field of the earth. The strength of
the earth’s magnetic ﬁeld varies from place to place on the earth’s surface;
its value being of the order of 10‘5 T.

What causes the earth to have a magnetic ﬁeld is not clear. Originally
the magnetic ﬁeld was thought of as arising from a giant bar magnet
placed approximately along the axis of rotation of the earth and deep in
the interior. However, this simplistic picture is certainly not correct. The
magnetic ﬁeld is now thought to arise due to electrical currents produced
by convective motion of metallic ﬂuids (consisting mostly of molten
iron and nickel) in the outer core of the earth. This is known as the
dynamo effect.

The magnetic ﬁeld lines of the earth resemble that of a (hypothetical)
magnetic dipole located at the centre of the earth. The axis of the dipole
does not coincide with the axis of rotation of the earth but is presently
titled by approximately 1 1.3° with respect to the later. In this way of looking
at it, the magnetic poles are located where the magnetic ﬁeld lines due to
the dipole enter or leave the earth. The location of the north magnetic pole
is at a latitude of 79.74° N and a longitude of 7 1.8° W, a place somewhere
in north Canada. The magnetic south pole is at 79.74° S, 108.22° E in
the Antarctica.

The pole near the geographic north pole of the earth is called the north
magnetic pole. Likewise, the pole near the geographic south pole is called
