(iii) The electrostatic field is along the displacement vector joining the
source and the ﬁeld point. The magnetic ﬁeld is perpendicular to the
plane containing the displacement vector 1' and the current element
I dl.

(iv) There is an angle dependence in the Biot—Savart law which is not
present in the electrostatic case. In Fig. 4.9, the magnetic field at any
point in the direction of dl (the dashed line) is zero. Along this line,
9 = 0, sin 6 = O and from Eq. [4.1 1(a)], IdBI = 0.

There is an interesting relation between 80, the permittivity of free
space; ,uo, the permeability of free space; and c, the speed of light in
vacuum:

 

#0 1 —7 1 1
= 4 _ 2 2— __
80% (“a“) 4n 9x109 (10 ) (3x108)2 c2

We will discuss this connection further in Chapter 8 on the
electromagnetic waves. Since the speed of light in vacuum is constant,
the product #080 is fixed in magnitude. Choosing the value of either so or

,uo, fixes the value of the other. In 81 units, #0 is fixed to be equal to
47: X 10‘7 in magnitude.

Example 4.5 An element Al 2 Axi is placed at the origin and carries

a large current I = 10 A (Fig. 4.10). What is the magnetic field on the
y-aXis at a distance of 0.5 m. Ax = 1 cm.

The direction of the field is in the +z-direction. This is so since,

|dB| = = 4 x 10‘8 T

dlxr=Axixyj = yAX(i><i) =yAxf:

We remind you of the following cyclic property of cross-products,
ixj=li;jxli=i;lixi=j

Note that the field is small in magnitude.
