. 1 1 The length, breadth and thickness of a rectangular sheet of metal are 4.234 m, 1.005 m,

and 2.0 1 cm respectively. Give the area and volume of the sheet to correct significant
figures.

.12 The mass of a box measured by a grocer’s balance is 2.30 kg. Two gold pieces of

masses 20.15 g and 20.17 g are added to the box. What is (a) the total mass of the
box, (b) the difference in the masses of the pieces to correct significant figures ?

. 13 A physical quantity P is related to four observables a, b, c and d as follows :

P: aSbZ/(Jcid)

The percentage errors of measurement in a, b, c and d are 1%, 3%, 4% and 2%,
respectively. What is the percentage error in the quantity P? If the value of Pcalculated
using the above relation turns out to be 3.763, to what value should you round off
the result ?

. 14 A book with many printing errors contains four different formulas for the displacement

y of a particle undergoing a certain periodic motion :
[a] y = a sin 211: t/T

(b) y = a sin vt

(C) y = (a/Tl sin t/a

[d] y = (ch/2) {sin 27tt/ T + cos 27tt/T)
[a = maximum displacement of the particle, v = speed of the particle. T= time—period
of motion]. Rule out the wrong formulas on dimensional grounds.

.15 A famous relation in physics relates ‘moving mass’ m to the ‘rest mass’ m0 of a

particle in terms of its speed 1) and the speed of light, c. [This relation first arose as
a consequence of special relativity due to Albert Einstein). A boy recalls the relation
almost correctly but forgets where to put the constant c. He writes :

m0

m:

Guess where to put the missing 0.

.16 The unit of length convenient on the atomic scale is known as an angstrom and is

denoted by A: 1 A— — 10‘10 m. The size of a hydrogen atom is about 0. 5 A. What is the
total atomic volume in m3 of a mole of hydrogen atoms ?

.17 One mole of an ideal gas at standard temperature and pressure occupies 22.4 L

(molar volume). What is the ratio of molar volume to the atomic volume of a mole of
hydrogen ? (Take the size of hydrogen molecule to be about 1 A). Why is this ratio
so large ?

.18 Explain this common observation clearly : If you look out of the window of a fast

moving train, the nearby trees, houses etc. seem to move rapidly in a direction opposite
to the trains motion, but the distant objects [hill tops, the Moon, the stars etc.)
seem to be stationary. (In fact, since you are aware that you are moving, these
distant objects seem to move with you].

. 19 The principle of ‘parallax’ in section 2.3.1 is used in the determination of distances

of very distant stars. The baseline AB is the line joining the Earth's two locations six
months apart in its orbit around the Sun. That is, the baseline is about the diameter
of the Earth’s orbit z 3 x 1011m. However, even the nearest stars are so distant that
with such a long baseline, they show parallax only of the order of 1” (second) of arc
or so. A parsec is a convenient unit of length on the astronomical scale. It is the
distance of an object that will show a parallax of 1" [second of arc] from opposite
ends of a baseline equal to the distance from the Earth to the Sun. How much is a
parsec in terms of metres ?
