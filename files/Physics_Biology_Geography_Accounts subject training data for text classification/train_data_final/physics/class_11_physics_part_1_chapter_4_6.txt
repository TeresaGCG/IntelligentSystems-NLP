MOTION IN A PLANE

So far we have considered a vector lying in
an x—y plane. The same procedure can be used
to resolve a general vector A into three
components along x—, y-, and z—axes in three

dimensions. If a, [3, and Yare the angles*

between A and the x—, y-, and z-axes, respectively
[Fig. 4.9(d)], we have

 

Z (d)

Fig. 4.9 (d) A vectorA resolved into components along
x—, y—, and z—axes

AK 2 Acos a, Ay = Acos ,6, AZ 2 Acos 7 (4.16a)
In general, we have

A: Axi+ij+Azli (41-1613)
The magnitude of vector A is

A: .(Aﬁ +Aj +A§ (4.16c)

A position vector 1' can be expressed as
r=xi+y3+zft (4-17)

where x, y, and z are the components of 1' along
x—, y-, z-axes, respectively.

4.6 VECTOR ADDITION — ANALYTICAL
METHOD

Although the graphical method of adding vectors
helps us in visualising the vectors and the
resultant vector, it is sometimes tedious and has
limited accuracy. It is much easier to add vectors
by combining their respective components.
Consider two vectors A and B in x— y plane with
components AX, Ag and BX, By :

A
o

A=Axi+AyJ (4.18)

71
B: Bxi+Byj
Let R be their sum. We have
R =A+ B
= (Axi+ij) +(Bxi+Byj) (4.19a)

Since vectors obey the commutative and
associative laws, we can arrange and regroup
the vectors in Eq. (4.19a) as convenient to us :

R=(Ax+Bx)i+(Ay+By)3 (4.19b)
SinceR = in + Ry} (4.20)

we have, RX 2 AX + BX, Ry 2 Ag + By (4.21)

Thus, each component of the resultant
vector R is the sum of the corresponding
components of A and B.

In three dimensions, we have

A: Axi+ij+Azﬁ
B: Bxi+By3+ B21;
R=A+B=in+Ryj+RzlE

with RX 2 Ax + Bx
Ry 2 Ag + By
R2 2 AZ + BZ (4.22)

This method can be extended to addition and
subtraction of any number of vectors. For
example, if vectors a, b and c are given as

a: axi+ayj+azli
b = bx§+byj+bzfg

c = cxi + Cy} + 021A: (4.23a)
then, a vector T = a + b — c has components :
TX = ax + bx — cx

Ty = ay + by — Cy (4.23b)

Tzzaz+bZ—cz.

> Example 4.2 Find the magnitude and
direction of the resultant of two vectors A

and B in terms of their magnitudes and
angle Qbetween them.

 

* Note that angles a, [3, and yare angles in space. They are between pairs of lines, which are not coplanar.
