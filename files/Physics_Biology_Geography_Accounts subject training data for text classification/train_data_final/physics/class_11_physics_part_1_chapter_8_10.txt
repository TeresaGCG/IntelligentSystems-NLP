8.8 ESCAPE SPEED

If a stone is thrown by hand, we see it falls back
to the earth. Of course using machines we can
shoot an object with much greater speeds and
with greater and greater initial speed, the object
scales higher and higher heights. A natural
query that arises in our mind is the following:
‘can we throw an object with such high initial
speeds that it does not fall back to the earth?’

The principle of conservation of energy helps
us to answer this question. Suppose the object
did reach infinity and that its speed there was
Vf. The energy of an object is the sum of potential
and kinetic energy. As before W1 denotes that
gravitational potential energy of the object at
infinity. The total energy of the projectile at
infinity then is

If the object was thrown initially with a speed
Vi from a point at a distance (h+RE) from the
centre of the earth (RE = radius of the earth), its
energl initially was
1 2 GmME
E (h+RE)=—mVi ——+W1

By the principle of energy conservation
Eqs. (8.26) and (8.27) must be equal. Hence

The R.H.S. is a positive quantity with a
minimum value zero hence so must be the L.H.S.

Thus, an object can reach infinity as long as V1.

The minimum value of V1. corresponds to the
case when the L.H.S. of Eq. (8.29) equals zero.

Thus, the minimum speed required for an object
to reach infinity (i.e. escape from the earth)

If the object is thrown from the surface of

the earth, h = O, and we get

Using the relation 9 2 GM E / R2 , we get

(Vi)min = 1/2gRE (8.32)
Using the value of g and RE, numerically
(Vl.)mmzl 1.2 km/s. This is called the escape
speed, sometimes loosely called the escape
velocity.

Equation (8.32) applies equally well to an
object thrown from the surface of the moon with
g replaced by the acceleration due to Moon’s
gravity on its surface and rE replaced by the
radius of the moon. Both are smaller than their
values on earth and the escape speed for the
moon turns out to be 2.3 km/s, about five times
smaller. This is the reason that moon has no
atmosphere. Gas molecules if formed on the
surface of the moon having velocities larger than
this will escape the gravitational pull of the
moon.

 

} Example 8.4 Two uniform solid spheres
of equal radii R, but mass M and 4 M have
a centre to centre separation 6 R, as shown
in Fig. 8.10. The two spheres are held fixed.
A projectile of mass m is projected from
the surface of the sphere of mass M directly
towards the centre of the second sphere.
Obtain an expression for the minimum

speed v of the projectile so that it reaches
the surface of the second sphere.

Answer The projectile is acted upon by two
mutually opposing gravitational forces of the two
