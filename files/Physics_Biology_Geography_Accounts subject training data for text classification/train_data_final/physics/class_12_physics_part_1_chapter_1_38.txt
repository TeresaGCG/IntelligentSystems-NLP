where 11 is a unit vector normal to the plane and going away from it.

E is directed away from the plate if a is positive and toward the plate
if a is negative. Note that the above application of the Gauss’ law has
brought out an additional fact: E is independent of x also.

For a ﬁnite large planar sheet, Eq. (1.33) is approximately true in the
middle regions of the planar sheet, away from the ends.

1. 15.3 Field due to a uniformly charged thin spherical shell

Let a be the uniform surface charge density of a thin spherical shell of
radius R (Fig. 1.3 1). The situation has obvious spherical symmetry. The
field at any point P, outside or inside, can depend only on r (the radial
distance from the centre of the shell to the point) and must be radial (i.e.,
along the radius vector).

(i) Field outside the shell: Consider a point P outside the

shell with radius vector r. To calculate E at P, we take the Surface charge,/ ------- /\
Gaussian surface to be a sphere of radius r and with centre densityc ’

O, passing through P. All points on this sphere are equivalent
relative to the given charged configuration. (That is what we
mean by spherical symmetry.) The electric ﬁeld at each point
of the Gaussian surface, therefore, has the same magnitude
E and is along the radius vector at each point. Thus, E and
AS at every point are parallel and the ﬂux through each
element is E AS. Summing over all AS, the ﬂux through the
Gaussian surface is E X 4 at r2. The charge enclosed is

where q = 4 7rR2 ois the total charge on the spherical shell.

The electric ﬁeld is directed outward if q > O and inward if
q < O. This, however, is exactly the field produced by a charge
q placed at the centre 0. Thus for points outside the shell, the field due
to a uniformly charged shell is as if the entire charge of the shell is
concentrated at its centre.

(ii) Field inside the shell: In Fig. 1.31(b), the point P is inside the
shell. The Gaussian surface is again a sphere through P centred at 0.
