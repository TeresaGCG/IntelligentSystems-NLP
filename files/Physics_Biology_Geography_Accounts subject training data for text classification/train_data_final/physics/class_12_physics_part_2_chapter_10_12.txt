The British physicist Thomas Young used an SOdium LamP
ingenious technique to “lock” the phases of the waves Screen
emanating from S1 and S2. He made two pinholes 81 FIGURE 10_ 11 If two sodium
and 82 (very close to each other) on an opaque screen lamps illuminate two pinholes
[Fig 10.12(a)]. These were illuminated by another 51 and 32- the intensities will add
pinholes that was in turn, lit by a bright source. Light up and no interference fringes will
waves spread out from S and fall on both S1 and 82. be observed on the screen.

81 and 82 then behave like two coherent sources

because light waves coming out from S1 and S2 are derived from the
same original source and any abrupt phase change in S will manifest in
exactly similar phase changes in the light coming out from S1 and S2.
Thus, the two sources S1 and S2 will be locked in phase; i.e., they will be
coherent like the two vibrating needle in our water wave example
[Fig 10.8(a)].

Thus spherical waves emanating from S1 and 82 will produce
interference fringes on the screen GG’, as shown in Fig. 10. 12(b). The
positions of maximum and minimum intensities can be calculated by
using the analysis given in Section 10.4 where we had shown that for an
arbitrary point P on the line GG’ [Fig. lO.12(b)] to correspond to a
maximum, we must have
