and the angular speed of the rotating particle. For simplicity, the sense of rotation
may be fixed to be anticlockwise in every case: (x is in cm and tis in s].

[a] = —2 sin [3t + n/S]
(b) x=cos (n/B—t)

[c] x= 3 sin [271:t+ n/4]
(d) x= 2 cos nt

14. 13 Figure 14.26 [a] shows a spring of force constant k clamped rigidly at one end and
a mass m attached to its free end. A force F applied at the free end stretches the
spring. Figure 14.26 (b) shows the same spring with both ends free and attached to
a mass m at either end. Each end of the spring in Fig. 14.26(b) is stretched by the
same force F.

(a) What is the maximum extension of the spring in the two cases ?
[b] If the mass in Fig. (a) and the two masses in Fig. [b] are released, what is the
period of oscillation in each case ?

14. 14 The piston in the cylinder head of a locomotive has a stroke [twice the amplitude)
of 1.0 m. Ifthe piston moves with simple harmonic motion with an angular frequency
of 200 rad / min, what is its maximum speed ?

14. 15 The acceleration due to gravity on the surface of moon is 1.7 m s”. What is the time
period of a simple pendulum on the surface of moon if its time period on the surface
of earth is 3.5 s ? [g on the surface of earth is 9.8 m s”)

14. 16 Answer the following questions :
[a] Time period of a particle in SHM depends on the force constant k and mass m
of the particle:

T = 2n 2. A simple pendulum executes SHM approximately. Why then is

the time period of a pendulum independent of the mass of the pendulum?

[b] The motion of a simple pendulum is approximately simple harmonic for small
angle oscillations. For larger angles of oscillation, a more involved analysis

I
shows that T is greater than 271? —. Think of a qualitative argument to

(0] A man with a wristwatch on his hand falls from the top of a tower. Does the
watch give correct time during the free fall ?

[d] What is the frequency of oscillation of a simple pendulum mounted in a cabin
that is freely falling under gravity ?

14. 17 A simple pendulum of length l and having a bob of mass M is suspended in a car.
The car is moving on a circular track of radius R with a uniform speed 1). If the
pendulum makes small oscillations in a radial direction about its equilibrium
position, what will be its time period ?
