A spherical capacitor consists of two concentric spherical conductors,
held in position by suitable insulating supports (Fig. 2.34). Show
that the capacitance of a spherical capacitor is given by

where r1 and r2 are the radii of outer and inner spheres,
respectively.

A spherical capacitor has an inner sphere of radius 12 cm and an
outer sphere of radius 13 cm. The outer sphere is earthed and the
inner sphere is given a charge of 2.5 11C. The space between the
concentric spheres is filled with a liquid of dielectric constant 32.

(a) Determine the capacitance of the capacitor.
(b) What is the potential of the inner sphere?

(c) Compare the capacitance of this capacitor with that of an
isolated sphere of radius 12 cm. Explain why the latter is much
smaller.

Answer carefully:

(a) Two large conducting spheres carrying charges Q1 and Q2 are
brought close to each other. Is the magnitude of electrostatic
force between them exactly given by Q1 Q2/47'C80r2, where r is
the distance between their centres?

(b) If Coulomb’s law involved 1/r3 dependence (instead of 1/r2),
would Gauss’s law be still true ?

(c) A small test charge is released at rest at a point in an
electrostatic field configuration. Will it travel along the field
line passing through that point?

(d) What is the work done by the field of a nucleus in a complete
circular orbit of the electron? What if the orbit is elliptical?
