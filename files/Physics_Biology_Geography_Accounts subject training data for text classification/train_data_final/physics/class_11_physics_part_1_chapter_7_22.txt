Pythagoras theorem, BC = 2J§ m. The forces

on the ladder are its weight W acting at its centre
of gravity D, reaction forces F1 and F2 of the wall
and the floor respectively. Force F1 is
perpendicular to the wall, since the wall is
frictionless. Force F2 is resolved into two
components, the normal reaction N and the
force of friction F. Note that Fprevents the ladder
from sliding away from the wall and is therefore
directed toward the wall.

For translational equilibrium, taking the
forces in the vertical direction,

N — W = O (i)
Taking the forces in the horizontal direction,
F — F1 = 0 (ii)

For rotational equilibrium, taking the
moments of the forces about A,

2J5F,—(1/2)W=0 (iii)

Now W=20g=20X9.8N=196.0N
From (i) N= 196.0 N

From (iii) F1 = W/4ﬁ = 196.0/4ﬁ = 34.6N
From (ii) F = F1 = 34.6N

F2 = F2 +N2 =199.0N

The force F2 makes an angle a with the
horizontal,

7.9 MOMENT OF INERTIA

We have already mentioned that we are
developing the study of rotational motion
parallel to the study of translational motion with
which we are familiar. We have yet to answer
one major question in this connection. What is
the analogue of mass in rotational motion?
We shall attempt to answer this question in the
present section. To keep the discussion simple,
we shall consider rotation about a fixed axis
only. Let us try to get an expression for the
kinetic energy of a rotating body. We know
that for a body rotating about a fixed axis, each
particle of the body moves in a circle with linear
velocity given by Eq. (7.19). (Refer to Fig. 7.16).
For a particle at a distance from the axis, the

linear velocity is vi = ria). The kinetic energy of
motion of this particle is

ki = lrnivi2 = imirizwz
2 2

where miis the mass of the particle. The total
kinetic energy K of the body is then given by
the sum of the kinetic energies of individual
particles,

K = ilk, = gimirfwz)
i:1 i:1

Here n is the number of particles in the body.
Note wis the same for all particles. Hence, taking
wout of the sum,

K = l(02(anmiri2)
2 i:l

We define a new parameter characterising
the rigid body, called the moment of inertia I ,
given by

I = Emir? (7.34)
i:l
With this definition,
1
K = 51602 (7.35)

Note that the parameter I is independent of
the magnitude of the angular velocity. It is a
characteristic of the rigid body and the axis
about which it rotates.

Compare Eq. (7 .35) for the kinetic energy of
a rotating body with the expression for the
kinetic energy of a body in linear (translational)
motion,

K=lmv2
2

Here, m is the mass of the body and v is its
velocity. We have already noted the analogy
between angular velocity to (in respect of rotational
motion about a fixed axis) and linear velocity v (in
respect of linear motion). It is then evident that
the parameter, moment of inertia I, is the desired
rotational analogue of mass in linear motion. In
rotation (about a ﬁxed axis), the moment of inertia
plays a similar role as mass does in linear motion.

We now apply the definition Eq. (7.34), to
calculate the moment of inertia in two simple
cases.
