Fig. 14.4 The location of the particle in SHM at the
discrete values t = 0, T/ 4, T/ 2, 3T/ 4, T,
5T/ 4. The time after which motion repeats
itselfis T. T will remain ﬁxed, no matter
what location you choose as the initial (t =
0) location. The speed is maximum for zero
displacement (at x = 0) and zero at the
extremes of motion.

of motion. Fig. 14.5 plots the graph of xversus t,
which gives the values of displacement as a
continuous function of time. The quantities A,
a) and {/3 which characterize a given SHM have
standard names, as summarised in Fig. 14.6.
Let us understand these quantities.

Fig. 14.6 The meaning of standard symbols
in Eq. (1 4. 4)

The amplitutde A of SHM is the magnitude
of maximum displacement of the particle.
[Note, A can be taken to be positive without
any loss of generality]. As the cosine function
of time varies from + 1 to —1, the displacement
varies between the extremes A and — A. Two
simple harmonic motions may have same a)
and ¢ but different amplitudes A and B, as
shown in Fig. 14.7 (a).

Fig. 14.7 (a) A plot ofdisplacement as afunction of
time as obtained from Eq. (14.4) with
q) = 0. The curves 1 and 2 are for two
different amplitudes A and B.

While the amplitude A is fixed for a given
SHM, the state of motion (position and velocity)
of the particle at any time tis determined by the
argument (wt + ¢) in the cosine function. This
time-dependent quantity, (wt + ¢) is called the
phase of the motion. The value of plase at t= O
is q) and is called the phase constant (or phase
angle). If the amplitude is known, ¢ can be
determined from the displacement at t= 0. Two
simple harmonic motions may have the same A
and a) but different phase angle ()3, as shown in
Fig. 14.7 (b).
