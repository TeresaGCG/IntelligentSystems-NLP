immediately gives us the relations I1 = I3 and I2 = I 4. Next, we apply
Kirchhoffs loop rule to closed loops ADBA and CBDC. The first

loop gives

—11R1+0+12R2=0 (Ig=0) (3.81)
and the second loop gives, upon using I3 = 11, I 4 = I2

I2 R4+0—I1 R3=O (3.82)
From Eq. (3.81), we obtain,

1_1 2 i

12 R1
whereas from Eq. (3.82), we obtain,

1_1 _ £

12 R3
Hence, we obtain the condition

This last equation relating the four resistors is called the balance
condition for the galvanometer to give zero or null deﬂection.

The Wheatstone bridge and its balance condition provide a practical
method for determination of an unknown resistance. Let us suppose we
have an unknown resistance, which we insert in the fourth arm; R4 is
thus not known. Keeping known resistances R1 and R2 in the first and
second arm of the bridge, we go on varying R3 till the galvanometer shows
a null deﬂection. The bridge then is balanced, and from the balance
condition the value of the unknown resistance R 4 is given by,

_ &
R4 —R3 R1 [3.83(b)]

A practical device using this principle is called the meter bridge. It
will be discussed in the next section.

Example 3.8 The four arms of a Wheatstone bridge (Fig. 3.26) have

the following resistances:
AB = 1009, BC = 109, CD = 59, and DA = 609.
