wavelength extends all over space. By Born’s
probability interpretation this means that the
electron is not localised in any ﬁnite region of
space. That is, its position uncertainty is inﬁnite
(Ax a co), which is consistent with the
uncertainty principle.

In general, the matter wave associated with
the electron is not extended all over space. It is
a wave packet extending over some ﬁnite region
of space. In that case Axis not inﬁnite but has
some ﬁnite value depending on the extension
of the wave packet. Also, you must appreciate
that a wave packet of ﬁnite extension does not
have a single wavelength. It is built up of
wavelengths spread around some central
wavelength.

By de Broglie’s relation, then, the
momentum of the electron will also have a
spread — an uncertainty Ap. This is as expected
from the uncertainty principle. It can be shown
that the wave packet description together with
de Broglie relation and Born’s probability
interpretation reproduce the Heisenberg’s
uncertainty principle exactly.

In Chapter 12, the de Broglie relation will
be seen to justify Bohr’s postulate on
quantisation of angular momentum of electron
in an atom.

Figure 1 1.6 shows a schematic diagram of
(a) a localised wave packet, and (b) an extended
wave with ﬁxed wavelength.

Example 11.4 What is the de Broglie wavelength associated with (a) an
electron moving with a speed of 5.4x106 m/s, and (b) a ball of mass 150

g traveﬂmg at 30.0 m/s?

Solution
(a) For the electron:

Mass m = 9.11><10’31 kg, speed 1) = 5.4><106 m/s. Then, momentum

p = m u = 9.11><10‘31 (kg) x 5.4 x 106 (m/s)
p = 4.92 x 10—24 kg m/s
de Broglie wavelength, 7» = h/ p

_ 6.63><10“'34 Js
_ 4.92x10‘24 kg m/s
x1= 0.135 nm
(b) For the ball:

Mass m’ = 0.150 kg, speed 1) ’ = 30.0 m/s.

Then momentum p’ = m’ U’ = 0.150 (kg) x 30.0 (m/s)

p’= 4.50 kg m/s
de Broglie wavelength N = h/p’.
