Electromagnetic
Induction

 

Solution The angle 0 made by the area vector of the coil with the
magnetic ﬁeld is 45°. From Eq. (6.1), the initial magnetic ﬂux is

<15: BA cos 0
_ 0.1 x 10‘2 Wb
J5

Final ﬂux, 45m = 0

The change in ﬂux is brought about in 0.70 s. From Eq. (6.3), the
magnitude of the induced emf is given by

IA¢BI_I<¢—0)I _ 10-3 _
At ‘ At "W401“

And the magnitude of the current is

 

 

8:

_ 5 _ 10‘3v _ 2
' R ' 0.59 ‘
Note that the earth’s magnetic field also produces a ﬂux through the

loop. But it is a steady ﬁeld (which does not change within the time
span of the experiment) and hence does not induce any emf.

 

Example 6.3

A circular coil of radius 10 cm, 500 turns and resistance 2 $2 is placed
with its plane perpendicular to the horizontal component of the earth’s
magnetic ﬁeld. It is rotated about its vertical diameter through 180°
in 0.25 s. Estimate the magnitudes of the emf and current induced in
the coil. Horizontal component of the earth’s magnetic field at the
place is 3.0 X 10“5 T.

Solution
Initial ﬂux through the coil,
4513mm) = BA cos 6
= 3.0 x 10‘5 x (n x104) x cos 0°
= 3n x 10‘7 Wb
Final ﬂux after the rotation,
4513mm) = 3.0 X 10‘5 X (7!? X102) X cos 180°

= —3n x 10‘7 Wb

Therefore, estimated value of the induced emf is,

g: NA_¢
At

= 500 x (61: x 10‘7)/o.25
= 3.8 x 10—3 v
I = e/R = 1.9 x 10‘3A

Note that the magnitudes of 8 and I are the estimated values. Their
instantaneous values are different and depend upon the speed of

rotation at the particular instant.
