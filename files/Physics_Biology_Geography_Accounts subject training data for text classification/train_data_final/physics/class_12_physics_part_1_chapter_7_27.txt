having a span of 25 m, if the Earth’s magnetic field at the location

Suppose the loop in Exercise 64 is stationary but the current
feeding the electromagnet that produces the magnetic field is
gradually reduced so that the field decreases from its initial value
of 0.3 T at the rate of 0.02 T S'l. If the cut is joined and the loop
has a resistance of 1.6 S), how much power is dissipated by the
loop as heat? What is the source of this power?

A square loop of side 12 cm with its sides parallel to X and Y axes is
moved with a velocity of 8 cm S'1 in the positive x—direction in an
environment containing a magnetic field in the positive z-direction.
The field is neither uniform in space nor constant in time. It has a
gradient of 10 '3 T cm‘1 along the negative x—direction (that is it increases
by 10'3 T cm'1 as one moves in the negative x—direction), and it is
decreasing in time at the rate of 10‘3T s‘l. Determine the direction and
magnitude of the induced current in the loop if its resistance is 4.50 m9.

It is desired to measure the magnitude of ﬁeld between the poles of a
powerful loud speaker magnet. A small ﬂat search coil of area 2 cm2
with 25 closely wound turns, is positioned normal to the field
direction, and then quickly snatched out of the field region.
Equivalently, one can give it a quick 90° turn to bring its plane
parallel to the field direction). The total charge ﬂown in the coil
(measured by a ballistic galvanometer connected to coil) is
7.5 mC. The combined resistance of the coil and the galvanometer is
0.50 9. Estimate the field strength of magnet.

Figure 6.20 shows a metal rod PQ resting on the smooth rails AB
and positioned between the poles of a permanent magnet. The rails,
the rod, and the magnetic field are in three mutual perpendicular
directions. A galvanometer G connects the rails through a switch K.
Length of the rod = 15 cm, B = 0.50 T, resistance of the closed loop
containing the rod = 9.0 m9. Assume the ﬁeld to be uniform.
(a) Suppose K is open and the rod is moved with a speed of 12 cm s—1
in the direction shown. Give the polarity and magnitude of the
induced emf.

(b) Is there an excess charge built up at the ends of the rods when
K is open? What if K is closed?

(c) With K open and the rod moving uniformly, there is no net
force on the electrons in the rod PQ even though they do
