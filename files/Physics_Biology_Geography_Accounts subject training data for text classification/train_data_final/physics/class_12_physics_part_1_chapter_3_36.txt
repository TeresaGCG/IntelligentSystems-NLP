ﬁeld, how much time (roughly) would be required to neutralise the

earth’s surface? (This never happens in practice because there is a

mechanism to replenish electric charges, namely the continual

thunderstorms and lightning in different parts of the globe). (Radius

of earth = 6.37 X 106 m.)

(a) Six lead-acid type of secondary cells each of emf 2.0 V and internal
resistance 0.015 9 are joined in series to provide a supply to a
resistance of 8.5 S2. What are the current drawn from the supply
and its terminal voltage?

(b) A secondary cell after long use has an emf of 1.9 V and a large
internal resistance of 380 S2. What maximum current can be drawn
from the cell? Could the cell drive the starting motor of a car?

Two wires of equal length, one of aluminium and the other of copper

have the same resistance. Which of the two wires is lighter? Hence

explain why aluminium wires are preferred for overhead power cables.

(pAl = 2.63 X 10‘8 Q m, pCu = 1.72 X 10‘8 Q m, Relative density of

A1 = 2.7, of Cu = 8.9.)

What conclusion can you draw from the following observations on a

resistor made of alloy manganin?

Answer the following questions:

(a) A steady current ﬂows in a metallic conductor of non-uniform
cross-section. Which of these quantities is constant along the
conductor: current, current density, electric field, drift speed?

(b) Is Ohm’s law universally applicable for all conducting elements?
If not, give examples of elements which do not obey Ohm’s law.

(c) A low voltage supply from which one needs high currents must
have very low internal resistance. Why?

((1) A high tension (HT) supply of, say, 6 kV must have a very large
internal resistance. Why?

Choose the correct alternative:

(a) Alloys of metals usually have (greater/less) resistivity than that
of their constituent metals.

(b) Alloys usually have much (lower/higher) temperature
coefficients of resistance than pure metals.

(c) The resistivity of the alloy manganin is nearly independent of/
increases rapidly with increase of temperature.

(d) The resistivity of a typical insulator (e.g., amber) is greater than
that of a metal by a factor of the order of (1022/1023).

(a) Given n resistors each of resistance R, how will you combine
them to get the (i) maximum (ii) minimum effective resistance?
What is the ratio of the maximum to minimum resistance?

(b) Given the resistances of 1 Q, 2 Q, 3 9, how will be combine them
to get an equivalent resistance of (i) (1 1/3) 9 (ii) (11/ 5) 9, (iii) 6
S2, (iv) (6/11) 9?

(c) Determine the equivalent resistance of networks shown in
Fig. 3.31.
