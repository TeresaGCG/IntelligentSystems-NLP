Show that the two—body decay of this type must necessarily give an electron of fixed
energy and, therefore, cannot account for the observed continuous energy distribution
in the B—decay of a neutron or a nucleus (Fig. 6.19].

[Note: The simple result of this exercise was one among the several arguments advanced by W.
Pauli to predict the existence of a third particle in the decay products of ﬁ—decay. This
particle is known as neutrino. We now know that it is a particle of intrinsic spin 1/2 (like
6, p or n}, but is neutral, and either massless or having an extremely small mass
[compared to the mass of electron] and which interacts very weakly with matter. The
correct decay process of neutron is : n -9 p + e’+ v ]
