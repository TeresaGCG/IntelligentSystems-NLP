The zeroth law of thermodynamics states that ‘two systems in thermal equilibrium with a
third system separately are in thermal equilibrium with each other”. The Zeroth Law leads
to the concept of temperature.

Internal energy of a system is the sum of kinetic energies and potential energies of the
molecular constituents of the system. It does not include the over—all kinetic energy of
the system. Heat and work are two modes of energy transfer to the system. Heat is the
energy transfer arising due to temperature difference between the system and the
surroundings. Work is energy transfer brought. about. by other means. such as moving

the piston of a cylinder containing the gas. by raising or lowering some weight. connected
to it.

The first. law of thermodynamics is the general law of conservation of energy applied to
any system in which energy transfer from or to the surroundings (through heat and
work) is taken into account. It states that

AQ =AU+ AW

where AQ is the heat supplied to the system. AWis the work done by the system and AU
is the change in internal energy of the system.
