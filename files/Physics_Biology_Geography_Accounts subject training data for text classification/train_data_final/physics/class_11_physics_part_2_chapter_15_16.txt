are heard at the same time, we hear a sound of
similar frequency (the average of two close
frequencies), but we hear something else also.
We hear audibly distinct waxing and waning of
the intensity of the sound, with a frequency
equal to the difference in the two close
frequencies. Artists use this phenomenon often
while tuning their instruments with each other.
They go on tuning until their sensitive ears do
not detect any beats.

To see this mathematically, let us consider
two harmonic sound waves of nearly equal
angular frequency 031 and 032 and ﬁx the location
to be X = O for convenience. Eq. (15.2) with a
suitable choice of phase (4) = 7: / 2 for each) and,
assuming equal amplitudes, gives

31: a cos (alt and $2 = a cos cozt (15.45)

Here we have replaced the symbol y by 5,
since we are referring to longitudinal not
transverse displacement. Let co1 be the (slightly)
greater of the two frequencies. The resultant
displacement is, by the principle of
superposition,

s= 31 +32 = a(cosw1t+cos w2t)

Using the familiar trignometric identity for
cos A + cosB, we get

Musical Pillars

Temples often have
some pillars
portraying human
figures playing
musical instru-
ments. but seldom
do these pillars
themselves produce
music. At the
Nellaiappar temple
in Tamil Nadu.
gentle taps on a
cluster of pillars carved out of a single piece
of rock produce the basic notes of Indian
classical music. viz. Sa, Re. Ga. Ma. Pa. Dha.
Ni. Sa. Vibrations of these pillars depend on
elasticity of the stone used, its density and
shape.

Musical pillars are categorised into three
types: The first is called the Shruti Pillar.
as it can produce the basic notes — the
“swaras”. The second type is the Gana
Thoongal, which generates the basic tunes
that make up the “ragas”. The third variety
is the Laya Thoongal pillars that produce
“taal” (beats) when tapped. The pillars at the
Nellaiappar temple are a combination of the
Shruti and Laya types.

Archaeologists date the Nelliappar
temple to the 7th century and claim it was
built by successive rulers of the Pandyan
dynasty.

The musical pillars of Nelliappar and
several other temples in southern India like
those at Hampi (picture). Kanyakumari. and
Thiruvananthapuram are unique to the
country and have no parallel in any other
part of the world.

not constant in time, unlike a pure harmonic
