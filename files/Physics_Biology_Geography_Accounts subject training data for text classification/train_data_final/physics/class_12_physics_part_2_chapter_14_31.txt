14.8 The number of silicon atoms per n13 is 5 x 1028. This is doped
simultaneously with 5 x 1022 atoms per n13 of Arsenic and 5 x 1020

per n13 atoms of Indium. Calculate the number of electrons and holes.
Given that nl. = 1.5 x 1016 m’s. Is the material n-type or p-type?

14.9 In an intrinsic semiconductor the energy gap E9 is 1.2eV. Its hole
mobility is much smaller than electron mobility and independent of
temperature. What is the ratio between conductivity at 600K and
that at 300K? Assume that the temperature dependence of intrinsic
carrier concentration n1. is given by

where 110 is a constant.

 

14.10 In a p-n junction diode, the current I can be expressed as

I = I0 exp [ZZVT —1]

B

 

where I0 is called the reverse saturation current, V is the voltage
across the diode and is positive for forward bias and negative for
reverse bias, and I is the current through the diode, ICE is the
Boltzmann constant (8.6X10‘5 eV/K) and T is the absolute
temperature. If for a given diode IO = 5 X IO’IZA and T = 300 K, then

(a) What will be the forward current at a forward voltage of 0.6 V?

(b) What will be the increase in the current if the voltage across the
diode is increased to 0.7 V?

(c) What is the dynamic resistance?

(d) What will be the current if reverse bias voltage changes from 1 V
to 2 V?
