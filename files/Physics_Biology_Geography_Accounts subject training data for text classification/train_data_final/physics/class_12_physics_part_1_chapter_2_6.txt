Electrostatic Potential

where f' is the unit vector along the position vector OP.
The electric potential of a dipole is then given by

1 p_..~.-

V = .
47:80 r2 , (r>> a) (2.15)

 

Equation (2. 1 5) is, as indicated, approximately true only for distances
large compared to the size of the dipole, so that higher order terms in
a/ r are negligible. For a point dipole p at the origin, Eq. (2. 1 5) is, however,
exact.

From Eq. (2.15), potential on the dipole axis (0 = O, at ) is given by

(Positive sign for 0 = 0, negative sign for 0 = at.) The potential in the
equatorial plane (0 = TC / 2) is zero.
The important contrasting features of electric potential of a dipole
from that due to a single charge are clear from Eqs. (2.8) and (2.15):
(i) The potential due to a dipole depends not just on r but also on the
angle between the position vector 1' and the dipole moment vector p.
(It is, however, axially symmetric about p. That is, if you rotate the
position vector r about p, keeping 0 fixed, the points corresponding
to P on the cone so generated will have the same potential as at P.)
(ii) The electric dipole potential falls off, at large distance, as 1 / r2, not as
1 / r, characteristic of the potential due to a single charge. (You can
refer to the Fig. 2.5 for graphs of 1/r2 versus r and 1/r versus r,
drawn there in another context.)

2.5 POTENTIAL DUE TO A SYSTEM OF CHARGES

Consider a system of charges q1, q2,..., qn with position vectors r1, r2,...,

rn relative to some origin (Fig. 2.6). The potential V1 at P due to the charge
q1 is
V. = 1 i
47:80 r1P

 

where r11, is the distance between q1 and P.

Similarly, the potential V2 at P due to q2 and
V3 due to q3 are given by

where rm) and r3? are the distances of P from
charges q2 and q3, respectively; and so on for the
potential due to other charges. By thC FIGURE 2.6 Potential at a point due to a
