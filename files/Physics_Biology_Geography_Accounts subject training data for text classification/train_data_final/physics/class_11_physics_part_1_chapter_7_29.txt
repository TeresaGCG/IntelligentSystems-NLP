at P1. and 061 is the angle between F1 and the
radius vector 0P1; ((51 + 061 = 90°.

The torque due to F1 about the origin is
OP1 XFI. Now OP1 = 00 + 0P1. [Refer to
Fig. 7 .17 (b).] Since 00 is along the axis, the
torque resulting from it is excluded from our
consideration. The effective torque due to F1 is
11= CPXFI; it is directed along the axis of rotation
and has a magnitude 1'1: rlF1 sinoc , Therefore,

dW1 = Tlde

If there are more than one forces acting on
the body, the work done by all of them can be
added to give the total work done on the body.

Denoting the magnitudes of the torques due to

the different forces as 11, 1'2, etc,

dW 2 (1'1 + 2'2 + ...)d6

Remember, the forces giving rise to the
torques act on different particles, but the

angular displacement d9 is the same for all
particles. Since all the torques considered are
parallel to the fixed axis, the magnitude 10f the
total torque is just the algebraic sum of the
magnitudes of the torques, i.e., 1': 11+ 12 + .....
We, therefore, have

dW= 7010 (7.41)

This expression gives the work done by the
total (external) torque ”C which acts on the body
rotating about a fixed axis. Its similarity with
the corresponding expression

dW= F ds
for linear (translational) motion is obvious.

Dividing both sides of Eq. (7.41) by dt gives

This is the instantaneous power. Compare
this expression for power in the case of
rotational motion about a fixed axis with that of
power in the case of linear motion,

P = Fv

In a perfectly rigid body there is no internal
motion. The work done by external torques is
therefore, not dissipated and goes on to increase
the kinetic energy of the body. The rate at which
work is done on the body is given by Eq. (7.42).
This is to be equated to the rate at which kinetic
energy increases. The rate of increase of kinetic
energy is

1 1w2 _I(2w)d_w

We assume that the moment of inertia does
not change with time. This means that the mass
of the body does not change, the body remains
rigid and also the axis does not change its
position with respect to the body.

Since a: dw/dt, we get

d 1602

Equating rates of work done and of increase
in kinetic energy,
