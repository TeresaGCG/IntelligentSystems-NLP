Fig. 7.18 17 = 1' x F, ris perpendicular to the plane
containing r and F, and its direction is
given by the right handed screw rule.

If a force acts on a single particle at a point
P whose position with respect to the origin 0 is
given by the position vector 1' (Fig. 7 . 18), the
moment of the force acting on the particle with
respect to the origin 0 is defined as the vector
product

1: = r x F (7.23)

The moment of force (or torque) is a vector
quantity. The symbol 1: stands for the Greek
letter tau. The magnitude of 1: is

1': rFsin0 (7.24a)
where r is the magnitude of the position vector
r, i.e. the length OP, Fis the magnitude of force
F and 0 is the angle between 1' and F as
shown.

Moment of force has dimensions M LZT'Z.
Its dimensions are the same as those of work
or energy. It is, however, a very different physical
quantity than work. Moment of a force is a
vector, while work is a scalar. The SI unit of
moment of force is newton metre (N m). The
magnitude of the moment of force may be
written

1 = (r sin 0)F = riF (7.24b)
or 2': rFsin6= rFi (7.240)

where ri = r sine is the perpendicular distance

of the line of action of F from the origin and
FJ: Fsin 6) is the component of F in the
direction perpendicular to 1'. Note that 1' = 0 if
r= O, F= O or 0 = Ooor 1800 . Thus, the moment
of a force vanishes if either the magnitude of
the force is zero, or if the line of action of the
force passes through the origin.

One may note that since rXF is a vector
product, properties of a vector product of two
vectors apply to it. If the direction of F is
reversed, the direction of the moment of force
is reversed. If directions of both r and F are
reversed, the direction of the moment of force
remains the same.

7.7.2 Angular momentum of a particle

Just as the moment of a force is the rotational
analogue of force in linear motion, the quantity
angular momentum is the rotational analogue
of linear momentum. We shall first define
angular momentum for the special case of a
single particle and look at its usefulness in the
context of single particle motion. We shall then
extend the deﬁnition of angular momentum to
systems of particles including rigid bodies.

Like moment of a force, angular momentum
is also a vector product. It could also be referred
to as moment of (linear) momentum. From this
term one could guess how angular momentum
is defined.

Consider a particle of mass m and linear
momentum p at a position 1' relative to the origin
0. The angular momentum] of the particle with
respect to the origin 0 is defined to be

1 = r x p (7 .25a)

The magnitude of the angular momentum
vector is

l=rpsin6 (7.26a)

where p is the magnitude of p and 0 is the angle
between 1' and p. We may write

l=rpl or rip (7.26b)

where rl (= r sine) is the perpendicular distance
of the directional line of p from the origin and
p i (= p sin 6) is the component of p in a direction

perpendicular to r. We expect the angular
momentum to be zero (1 = 0), if the linear
momentum vanishes (p = 0), if the particle is at
the origin (r = O), or if the directional line of p
passes through the origin 6 = O0 or 180°.
