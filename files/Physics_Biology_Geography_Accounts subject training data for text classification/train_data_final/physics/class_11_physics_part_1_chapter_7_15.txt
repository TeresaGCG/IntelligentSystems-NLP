The physical quantities, moment of a force
and angular momentum, have an important
relation between them. It is the rotational
analogue of the relation between force and linear
momentum. For deriving the relation in the
context of a single particle, we differentiate
l = rXp with respect to time,

Thus, the time rate of change of the angular
momentum of a particle is equal to the torque
acting on it. This is the rotational analogue of
the equation F = dp/dt, which expresses
Newton’s second law for the translational motion
of a single particle.

Torque and angular momentum for a system
of particles

To get the total angular momentum of a system
of particles about a given point we need to add
vectorially the angular momenta of individual
particles. Thus, for a system of n particles,

L=ll+l2+...+ln 22L
i=1

The angular momentum of the th particle
is given by

1i = rixpi
where 1': is the position vector of the 1“Lh particle
with respect to a given origin and p = (mivi) is
the linear momentum of the particle. (The

An experiment with the bicycle rim

Take a
bicycle rim
and extend
its axle on
both sides.
Tie two
5 t r i n g s
at both ends
A and B.
as shown
in the
a d j oi n i n g
ﬁgure. Hold
both the
s t r i n g 5
together in
one hand such that the rim is vertical. If you
leave one string. the rim will tilt. Now keeping
the rim in vertical position with both the strings
in one hand, put the wheel in fast rotation
around the axle with the other hand. Then leave
one string, say B, from your hand. and observe
what happens.

The rim keeps rotating in a vertical plane
and the plane of rotation turns around the
string A which you are holding. We say that the
axis of rotation of the rim or equivalently
its angular momentum precesses about the
string A.

The rotating rim gives rise to an angular
momentum. Determine the direction of this
angular momentum. When you are holding the
rotating rim with string A. a torque is generated.
[We leave it to you to ﬁnd out how the torque is
generated and what its direction is.) The effect
of the torque on the angular momentum is to
make it precess around an axis perpendicular
to both the angular momentum and the torque.
Verify all these statements.

write the total angular momentum of a system

This is a generalisation of the definition of
angular momentum (Eq. 7 .25a) for a single
particle to a system of particles.

Using Eqs. (7.23) and (7.25b), we get
