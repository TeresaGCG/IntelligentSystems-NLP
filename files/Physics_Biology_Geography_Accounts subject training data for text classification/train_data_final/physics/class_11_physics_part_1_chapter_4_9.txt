Ats, respectively. The direction of the average

velocity V is shown in figures (a), (b) and (c) for
three decreasing values of At, i.e. At1,At2, and A133,
(At1 > At2 > Ats). As At —> 0, Ar —> O
and is along the tangent to the path [Fig 4. 13(d)].
Therefore, the direction of velocity at any point
on the path of an object is tangential to the
path at that point and is in the direction of
motion.

We can express v in a component form :

. AX: AU:
2 hm —1+—J (429)

At—>0 At At

At—>0 At At—>O At

Adx Ad A A
Or, v=i— —y=vxi+vyj.

where vx = —,v = — (4.30a)
So, if the expressions for the coordinates x and
y are known as functions of time, we can use
these equations to find vx and vy.

The magnitude of v is then

u = 1[vi + v3 (4-3013)

and the direction of v is given by the angle 9 :

v v
tan6 = —y, 9 = tan_1[_y] (4.3OC)

DX vx

vx, vy and angle 6 are shown in Fig. 4.14 for a
velocity vector v at point p.

Acceleration

The average acceleration a of an object for a
time interval At moving in x—y plane is the change
in velocity divided by the time interval :

a=—=—= 1+—J

vx=vcos 0, vy=vsin 0.

The acceleration (instantaneous acceleration)
is the limiting value of the average acceleration
as the time interval approaches zero :

As in the case of velocity, we can understand
graphically the limiting process used in defining
acceleration on a graph showing the path of the
object’s motion. This is shown in Figs. 4. 15(a) to
(d). P represents the position of the object at
time tand P1, P2, P3 positions after time Atl, At2,
At3, respectively (At 1> At2>At3). The velocity vectors
at points P, P1, P2, P3 are also shown in Figs. 4. 15
(a), (b) and (c). In each case of At, Av is obtained
using the triangle law of vector addition. By

definition, the direction of average acceleration
is the same as that of Av. We see that as At
decreases, the direction of Av changes and
consequently, the direction of the acceleration
changes. Finally, in the limit At ->O [Fig. 4. l5(d)],
the average acceleration becomes the
instantaneous acceleration and has the direction
as shown.
