In the absolute temperature scale, the zero of the scale corresponds to the temperature
where every substance in nature has the least possible molecular activity. The Kelvin
absolute temperature scale (T) has the same unit size as the Celsius scale (TC ). but
differs in the origin :

TC = T— 273.15

The coefficient of linear expansion (all) and volume expansion (av) are defined by the
relations :

Al
—= a,AT

AV
— = aVAT
V

where Al and AVdenote the change in length land volume Vfor a change of temperature
AT. The relation between them is :

05‘, = 3 0‘1

The specific heat capacity of a substance is defined by

52——
mAT

where m is the mass of the substance and AQ is the heat required to change its
temperature by AT. The molar specific heat capacity of a substance is defined by

_l§
_yAT

C

where ,u. is the number of moles of the substance.

The latent heat of fusion (Li) is the heat per unit mass required to change a substance
from solid into liquid at the same temperature and pressure. The latent heat of
vaporisation (LY) is the heat per unit mass required to change a substance from liquid

to the vapour state without change in the temperature and pressure.

The three modes of heat transfer are conduction, convection and radiation.

. In conduction. heat is transferred between neighbouring parts of a body through
molecular collisions, without any ﬂow of matter. For a bar of length L and uniform
cross section A with its ends maintained at temperatures TC and TD, the rate of flow of
heat H is :

T —T
H=KAM
L

where K is the thermal conductivity of the material of the bar.

. Newton’s Law of Cooling says that the rate of cooling of a body is proportional to the
excess temperature of the body over the surroundings :

<19; _
dt NE T.)

Where T1 is the temperature of the surrounding medium and T2 is the temperature of
the body.
