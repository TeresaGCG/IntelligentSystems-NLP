Electrostatic Potential

and Copocitonce

This expression can alternately be understood also from Eq. (2.29).
We apply Eq. (2.29) to the present system of two charges +q and —q. The
potential energy expression then reads

q

U'W) = q{V(1'1)— V(r2)]—m
0

(2.33)

Here, rl and r2 denote the position vectors of +q and —q. Now, the
potential difference between positions 1‘1 and 1'2 equals the work done
in bringing a unit positive charge against field from 1'2 to II. The
displacement parallel to the force is 2a cos0. Thus, [V(r1)—V (r2)] =
—E X 2a cos0 . We thus obtain,

, 612 612

U (49) _ pE C086 47560 x 2a p.E lingo >< 2a (2'34)

We note that U’(0) differs from U(0) by a quantity which is j ust a constant
for a given dipole. Since a constant is insignificant for potential energy, we
can drop the second term in Eq. (2.34) and it then reduces to Eq. (2.32).

We can now understand why we took Oozn/Z. In this case, the work
done against the external field E in bringing +q and — q are equal and
opposite and cancel out, i.e., q [V(r1) — V(r2)]=0.

Example 2.6 A molecule of a substance has a permanent electric
dipole moment of magnitude 10‘29 C m. A mole of this substance is
polarised (at low temperature) by applying a strong electrostatic field
of magnitude 106 V m‘l. The direction of the ﬁeld is suddenly changed
by an angle of 609. Estimate the heat released by the substance in
aligning its dipoles along the new direction of the field. For simplicity,
assume 100% polarisation of the sample.

Solution Here, dipole moment of each molecules = 10‘29 C In

As 1 mole of the substance contains 6 X 1023 molecules,

total dipole moment of all the molecules, p = 6 X 1023 X 10’29 C m
= 6 x 10‘6 c m

Initial potential energy, Ul. = —pE cos 0 = —6X10‘6X106 cos ° = —6 J

Final potential energy (when 9 = 60°), Lg = —6 x 1045 x 106 cos 60° = —3 J

Change in potential energy = —3 J — (—6J) = 3 J

So, there is loss in potential energy. This must be the energy released

by the substance in the form of heat in aligning its dipoles.

2.9 ELECTROSTATICS OF CONDUCTORS

Conductors and insulators were described brieﬂy in Chapter 1.
Conductors contain mobile charge carriers. In metallic conductors, these
charge carriers are electrons. In a metal, the outer (valence) electrons
part away from their atoms and are free to move. These electrons are free
within the metal but not free to leave the metal. The free electrons form a
kind of ‘gas’; they collide with each other and with the ions, and move
randomly in different directions. In an external electric field, they drift
against the direction of the field. The positive ions made up of the nuclei
and the bound electrons remain held in their fixed positions. In electrolytic
conductors, the charge carriers are both positive and negative ions; but
