Solution The network is not reducible to a simple series and parallel
combinations of resistors. There is, however, a clear symmetry in the
problem which we can exploit to obtain the equivalent resistance of
the network.
The paths AA’, AD and AB are obviously symmetrically placed in the
network. Thus, the current in each must be the same, say, I. Further,
at the corners A’, B and D, the incoming current I must split equally
into the two outgoing branches. In this manner, the current in all
the 12 edges of the cube are easily written down in terms of I, using
Kirchhoﬂ‘s first rule and the symmetry in the problem.
Next take a closed loop, say, ABCC’EA, and apply Kirchhoffs second
rule:

—IR — (1/2)IR— IR + 8= 0
where R is the resistance of each edge and 8 the emf of battery. Thus,

8=§IR
2

The equivalent resistance Req of the network is
E 5

Req = — =
31 6
For R = 1 Q, Req = (5/6) 9 and for 8 = 10 V, the total current (= 31) in
the network is
31= 10 V/(5/6) S2 = 12 A, i.e., I= 4A
The current ﬂowing in each edge can now be read off from the
Fig. 3.23.

It should be noted that because of the symmetry of the network, the
great power of Kirchhoff s rules has not been very apparent in Example 3.6.
In a general network, there will be no such simplification due
symmetry, and only by application of Kirchhoff s rules to junctions and
closed loops (as many as necessary to solve the unknowns in the network)
can we handle the problem. This will be illustrated in Example 3. 7.

Example 3.7 Determine the current in each branch of the network
shown in Fig. 3.24.
