both. The potential difference across the ends of the
combination is clearly sum of the potential difference
across the two individual slabs and hence equals 2V. The
current through the combination is I and the resistance
of the combination Rc is [from Eq. (3.3)],

was led to his law by an
analogy between the

electric ﬁeld is analogous to
the temperature gradient,

having a cross sectional area of A/ 2 [Fig. 3.2(c)].

For a given voltage Vacross the slab, if I is the current
through the entire slab, then clearly the current ﬂowing
through each of the two half-slabs is I / 2. Since the

Thus, halving the area of the cross-section of a conductor doubles
the resistance. In general, then the resistance R is inversely proportional

Current per unit area (taken normal to the current), I /A, is called
current density and is denoted by j. The SI units of the current density
are A/m2. Further, if E is the magnitude of uniform electric field in the
conductor whose length is I, then the potential difference Vacross its

96 ends is El. Using these, the last equation reads
