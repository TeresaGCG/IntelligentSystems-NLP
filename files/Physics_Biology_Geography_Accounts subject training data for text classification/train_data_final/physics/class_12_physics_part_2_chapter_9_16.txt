Substituting iand r from Eqs. (9.13) and (9.14), we get

3—;4+% = “1:1 (9.15)
Here, OM, MI and MC represent magnitudes of distances. Applying the
Cartesian sign convention,

OM =—u, M1 = +v, MC = +R

Substituting these in Eq. (9.15), we get

 

an = '12-'11
v u R (9.16)

Equation (9.1 6) gives us a relation between object and image distance
in terms of refractive index of the medium and the radius of
curvature of the curved spherical surface. It holds for any curved
spherical surface.

 

Example 9.6 Light from a point source in air falls on a spherical
glass surface (n = 1.5 and radius of curvature = 20 cm). The distance
of the light source from the glass surface is 100 cm. At What position
the image is formed?

 

 

 

Solution
We use the relation given by Eq. (9.16). Here
u=— 100 cm, v=?, R=+200m, n1 =1,and n2= 1.5.
We then have
1.5 1 0.5 F!
_+_=_
v 100 20 E
or v = +100 cm 5
The image is formed at a distance of 100 cm from the glass surface, (0
in the direction of incident light. ‘5,
9.5.2 Refraction by a lens
Figure 9. 18(a) shows the geometry of image formation by a double convex
lens. The image formation can be seen in terms of two steps:
(i) The first refracting surface forms the image I1 of the object 0
[Fig 9.18(b)]. The image I1 acts as a virtual object for the second surface
that forms the image at I [Fig. 9.18(c)]. Applying Eq. (9.15) to the first
interface ABC, we get
”1 n2 n2 _n1
—+_:
OB BI1 BC1 (9.17)
A similar procedure applied to the second interface* ADC gives,
n2 n1 n2 _n1
__+_:
DI1 DI DC2 (9'18)
* Note that now the refractive index of the medium on the right side of ADC is n1
while on its left it is n2. Further D11 is negative as the distance is measured
against the direction of incident light. 325
