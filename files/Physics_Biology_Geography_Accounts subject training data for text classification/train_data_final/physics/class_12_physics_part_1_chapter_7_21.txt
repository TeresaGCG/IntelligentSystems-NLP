(b) Phase difference, ¢ = tan’1#

= tan’1(%j = 753. 1°

Since o is negative, the current in the circuit lags the voltage
across the source.

(c) The power dissipated in the circuit is

Therefore, P = (40A)2 >< SQ = 4800 W
(d) Power factor =cos¢ = cos(—53.1°) = 0.6

Example 7.9 Suppose the frequency of the source in the previous
example can be varied. (a) What is the frequency of the source at
which resonance occurs? (b) Calculate the impedance, the current,
and the power dissipated at the resonant condition.

Solution

(a) The frequency at which the resonance occurs is

(00 _ = 73 76

(b) The impedance Z at resonant condition is equal to the resistance:
Z = R = 39

The rms current at resonance is

The power dissipated at resonance is
P=12xR=w67Fx3=1335kw

You can see that in the present case, power dissipated
at resonance is more than the power dissipated in Example 7.8.
