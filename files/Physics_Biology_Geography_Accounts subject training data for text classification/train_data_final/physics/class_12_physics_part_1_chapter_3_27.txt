A galvanometer of 15S) resistance is connected across BD. Calculate
the current through the galvanometer when a potential difference of
10 V is maintained across AC.

Solution Considering the mesh BADB, we have
10011 + 1519— 6012 = O

or 2011 + 319 — 1212: o [3.84(a)]

Considering the mesh BCDB, we have

10 (11 —19)— 1519—5 (12 +19) =0

1011 — 3019 —512 = O

211 — 619 — 12 = O [3.84(b)]
Considering the mesh ADCEA,

6012 + 5 (12 + 19

6512 + 519 = 10
1312 + 19 = 2
Multiplying Eq. (3

)=10

[384(0)]

.84b) by 10

2011 — 6019 — 1012 = O [3.84(d)]
From Eqs. (3.84d) and (3.84a) we have

6319 — 212 = o
12 = 31.519

13 (31.519) +
410.5 Ig= 2
I9 = 4.87 mA.

3. 15 METER BRIDGE

The meter bridge is shown in Fig. 3.27. It consists of
a wire of length 1 m and of uniform cross sectional
area stretched taut and clamped between two thick
metallic strips bent at right angles, as shown. The
metallic strip has two gaps across which resistors can
be connected. The end points where the wire is
clamped are connected to a cell through a key. One
end of a galvanometer is connected to the metallic
strip midway between the two gaps. The other end of
the galvanometer is connected to a jockey’. The jockey
is essentially a metallic rod whose one end has a
knife-edge which can slide over the wire to make
electrical connection.

R is an unknown resistance whose value we want to determine. It is
120 connected across one of the gaps. Across the other gap, we connect a
