and glass is acute. Thus the surface of water in
the capillary is concave. This means that
there is a pressure difference between the
two sides of the top surface. This is given by

(P.- — Pa) =(2S/ r) = 2S/(a sec 6)
= (2S/a) cos 0 (10.29)

Thus the pressure of the water inside the
tube, just at the meniscus (air—water interface)
is less than the atmospheric pressure. Consider
the two points A and B in Fig. 10.21(a). They
must be at the same pressure, namely

P0+ hpg=Pi=PA (10.30)
where p is the density of water and h is called
the capillary rise [Fig. 10.2 1(a)]. Using
Eq. (10.29) and (10.30) we have

hpg=(Pi—P0)=(2Scos0)/a (10.31)

The discussion here, and the Eqs. (10.26) and
(10.27) make it clear that the capillary rise is
due to surface tension. It is larger, for a smaller
a. Typically it is of the order of a few cm for fine
capillaries. For example, if a = 0.05 cm, using

the value of surface tension for water (Table
10.3), we find that

h=2S/(pga)

= 2X(0.073 N m'l)
(103 kgm'3) (9.8 ms'2)(5 X 10'4 m)

 

= 2.98 x 10‘2 m = 2.98 cm

Notice that if the liquid meniscus is convex,
as for mercury, i.e., if cos 0 is negative then from
Eq. (1 0.30) for example, it is clear that the liquid
will be lower in the capillary !

10.6.6 Detergents and Surface Tension

We clean dirty clothes containing grease and oil
stains sticking to cotton or other fabrics by
adding detergents or soap to water, soaking
clothes in it and shaking. Let us understand
this process better.

Washing with water does not remove grease
stains. This is because water does not wet greasy
dirt; i.e., there is very little area of contact
between them. If water could wet grease, the ﬂow
of water could carry some grease away.
Something of this sort is achieved through
detergents. The molecules of detergents are

hairpin shaped, with one end attracted to water
and the other to molecules of grease, oil or wax,
thus tending to form water-oil interfaces. The result
is shown in Fig. 10.22 as a sequence of ﬁgures.

In our language, we would say that addition
of detergents, whose molecules attract at one
end and say, oil on the other, reduces drastically
the surface tension S (water-oil). It may even
become energetically favourable to form such
interfaces, i.e., globs of dirt surrounded by
detergents and then by water. This kind of
process using surface active detergents or
surfactants is important not only for cleaning,
but also in recovering oil, mineral ores etc.

Soap molecules

 

Detergent is added, the 'inert' waxy ends
of its molecules are attracted to boundary
where water meets dirt.

 

Inert ends surround dirt and the platter dirt
can now be dislodged say by moving water.
