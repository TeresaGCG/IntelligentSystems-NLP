Solution Each branch of the network is assigned an unknown current
to be determined by the application of Kirchhoffs rules. To reduce
the number of unknowns at the outset, the ﬁrst rule of Kirchhoff is
used at every junction to assign the unknown current in each branch.
We then have three unknowns I1, I2 and I3 which can be found by
applying the second rule of Kirchhoff to three different closed loops.
Kirchhoffs second rule for the closed loop ADCA gives,

10 — 401— 12) + 202 + I3 — I1) — I1 = 0 [3.80(a)]
that is, 7I1— 6I2 — 2I3 = 10
For the closed loop ABCA, we get

10—412—2 (I2+13)—I1 =0
that is, II + ESI2 + 2I3 =10 [3.80(b)]
For the closed loop BCDEB, we get

5—2(I2+I3)—2(12+13—I1) =0
that is, 2I1 — 4I2 — 4I3 = —5 [380(0)]

Equations (3.80 a, b, c) are three simultaneous equations in three
unknowns. These can be solved by the usual method to give

It is easily verified that Kirchhoffs second rule applied to the
remaining closed loops does not provide any additional independent
equation, that is, the above values of currents satisfy the second
rule for every closed loop of the network. For example, the total voltage
drop over the closed loop BADEB

equal to zero, as required by Kirchhoffs second rule.

3. 14 WHEATSTONE BRIDGE

As an application of Kirchhoffs rules consider the circuit shown in
Fig. 3.25, which is called the Wheatstone bridge. The bridge has
four resistors R1, R2, R3 and R4. Across one pair of diagonally opposite
points (A and C in the figure) a source is connected. This (i.e., AC) is
called the battery arm. Between the other two vertices, B and D, a
galvanometer G (which is a device to detect currents) is connected. This
line, shown as BD in the ﬁgure, is called the galvanometer arm.

For simplicity, we assume that the cell has no internal resistance. In
general there will be currents ﬂowing across all the resistors as well as a
current I g through G. Of special interest, is the case of a balanced bridge
where the resistors are such that I g = 0. We can easily get the balance
condition, such that there is no current through G. In this case, the
Kirchhoffs junction rule applied to junctions D and B (see the figure)
