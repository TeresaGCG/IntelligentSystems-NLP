Monochromatic light of wavelength 589 nm is incident from air on a
water surface. What are the wavelength, frequency and speed of
(a) reﬂected, and (b) refracted light? Refractive index of water is
1.33.

What is the shape of the wavefront in each of the following cases:
(a) Light diverging from a point source.

(b) Light emerging out of a convex lens when a point source is placed
at its focus.

(c) The portion of the wavefront of light from a distant star intercepted
by the Earth.

(a) The refractive index of glass is 1.5. What is the speed of light in
glass? (Speed of light in vacuum is 3.0 X 108 m s’l)

(b) Is the speed of light in glass independent of the colour of light? If
not, which of the two colours red and violet travels slower in a
glass prism?

In a Young’s double-slit experiment, the slits are separated by
0.28 mm and the screen is placed 1.4 m away. The distance between
the central bright fringe and the fourth bright fringe is measured
to be 1.2 cm. Determine the wavelength of light used in the
experiment.

In Young’s double-slit experiment using monochromatic light of
wavelength x1, the intensity of light at a point on the screen where
path difference is x1, is K units. What is the intensity of light at a
point where path difference is xi/ 3?

A beam of light consisting of two wavelengths, 650 nm and 520 nm,
is used to obtain interference fringes in a Young’s double-slit
experiment.

(a) Find the distance of the third bright fringe on the screen from
the central maximum for wavelength 650 nm.

(b) What is the least distance from the central maximum where the
bright fringes due to both the wavelengths coincide?

In a double-slit experiment the angular width of a fringe is found to
be 02° on a screen placed 1 m away. The wavelength of light used is
600 nm. What will be the angular width of the fringe if the entire
experimental apparatus is immersed in water? Take refractive index
of water to be 4/3.

What is the Brewster angle for air to glass transition? (Refractive
index of glass = 1.5.)

Light of wavelength 5000 A falls on a plane reﬂecting surface. What
are the wavelength and frequency of the reﬂected light? For what
angle of incidence is the reﬂected ray normal to the incident ray?

Estimate the distance for which ray optics is good approximation
for an aperture of 4 mm and wavelength 400 nm.
