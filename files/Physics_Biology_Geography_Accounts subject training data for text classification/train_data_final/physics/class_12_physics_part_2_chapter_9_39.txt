(C) What is the height of the final image of the tower if it is formed at
25 cm?

A Cassegrain telescope uses two mirrors as shown in Fig. 9.30. Such
a telescope is built with the mirrors 20 mm apart. If the radius of
curvature of the large mirror is 220mm and the small mirror is
140 mm, where will the final image of an object at infinity be?

Light incident normally on a plane mirror attached to a galvanometer
coil retraces backwards as shown in Fig. 9.33. A current in the coil
produces a deﬂection of 35° of the mirror. What is the displacement
of the reﬂected spot of light on a screen placed 1.5 m away?

FIGURE 9.33

Figure 9.34 shows an equiconvex lens (of refractive index 1.50) in
contact with a liquid layer on top of a plane mirror. A small needle
with its tip on the principal axis is moved along the axis until its
inverted image is found at the position of the needle. The distance of
the needle from the lens is measured to be 45.0cm. The liquid is
removed and the experiment is repeated. The new distance is
measured to be 30.0 cm. What is the refractive index of the liquid?
