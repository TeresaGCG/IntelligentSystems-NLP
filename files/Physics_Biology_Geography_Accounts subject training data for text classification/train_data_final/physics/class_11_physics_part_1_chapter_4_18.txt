v = lim — = —. It can be written in unit vector notation as :

When position of an object is plotted on a coordinate system, v is always tangent to
the curve representing the path of the object.

v=vX1+vyJ+vzk where vx

If the velocity of an object changes from v to v’in time At, then its average acceleration
v — v' Av
At At .
The acceleration a at any time tis the limiting value of E as At —>0 :

lim Av dv

At —> 0 At dt

is given by: a =

 

In component form, we have : a = (1X1 + ayJ + azk

If an object is moving in a plane with constant acceleration a = lal = Jag + a: and

its position vector at time t = 0 is r0, then at any other time t, it will be at a point given
by:

1': r0 +vot+lat2

and its velocity is given by :

v = vo + a t
where V0 is the velocity at time t = 0
In component form :

Motion in a plane can be treated as superposition of two separate simultaneous one—
dimensional motions along two perpendicular directions
An object that is in ﬂight after being projected is called a projectile. If an object is
projected with initial velocity vo making an angle 00 with x—axis and if we assume its
initial position to coincide with the origin of the coordinate system, then the position
and velocity of the projectile at time t are given by :
x= [v0 cos 00) t
y = [vosin 00) t— (1/2) 9 t2
vx = vex = no cos 90
vy= vosin Oo—gt
The path of a projectile is parabolic and is given by :

The maximum height that a projectile attains is :
