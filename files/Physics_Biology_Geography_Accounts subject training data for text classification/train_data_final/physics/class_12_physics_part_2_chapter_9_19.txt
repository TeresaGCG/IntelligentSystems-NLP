length bends the incident light more, while converging it
in case of a convex lens and diverging it in case of a
concave lens. The power P of a lens is defined as the
tangent of the angle by which it converges or diverges a
beam of light falling at unit distant from the optical centre
(Fig. 9.20).

The SI unit for power of a lens is dioptre (D): ID = lm‘l. The power of
a lens of focal length of 1 metre is one dioptre. Power of a lens is positive
for a converging lens and negative for a diverging lens. Thus, when an
optician prescribes a corrective lens of power + 2.5 D, the required lens is
a convex lens of focal length + 40 cm. A lens of power of — 4.0 D means a
concave lens of focal length — 25 cm.

Example 9.8 (i) If f = 0.5 m for a glass lens, What is the power of the
lens? (ii) The radii of curvature of the faces of a double convex lens
are 10 cm and 15 cm. Its focal length is 12 cm. What is the refractive
index of glass? (iii) A convex lens has 20 cm focal length in air. What
is focal length in water? (Refractive index of air-water = 1.33, refractive
index for air-glass = 1.5.)

Solution
(i) Power = +2 dioptre.
(ii) Here, we havef= +12 cm, R1 = +10 cm, R2 = —15 cm.
Refractive index of air is taken as unity.
We use the lens formula of Eq. (9.22). The sign convention has to
be applied for f, R1 and R2.
Substituting the values, we have

i=(n_1) (i_;)

This gives n = 1.5.

(iii) For a glass lens in air, n2 = 15, n1 = 1, f = +20 cm. Hence, the lens
formula gives
