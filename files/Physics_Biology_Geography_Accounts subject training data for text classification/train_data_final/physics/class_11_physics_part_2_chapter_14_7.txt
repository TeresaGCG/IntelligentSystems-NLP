(b) In this case at t= 0, OP makes an angle of

900 = 1 with the x—aXis. After a time t, it

covers an angle of at in the clockwise

sense and makes an angle of (g — 2%t)

with the x—axis. The projection of OP on the
x—axis at time t is given by

x(t) =Bcos (2—2115)

For T=3O s,
x(t) =Bsin (1 t)

Writing this as x (t) = B cos (ﬁt — g] , and

comparing with Eq. (14.4). We find that this

represents a SHM of amplitude B, period 30 s,

and an initial phase of —g. 4

14.5 VELOCITY AND ACCELERATION IN
SIMPLE HARMONIC MOTION

The speed of a particle v in uniform circular
motion is its angular speed (0 times the radius
of the circle A.

v= (0A (14.8)

The direction of velocity 9 at a time t is along

the tangent to the circle at the point where the
particle is located at that instant. From the
geometry of Fig. 14. 1 1, it is clear that the velocity
of the projection particle P’ at time t is

v(t) = —wA sin (wt + (p) (14.9)

 

Fig. 1 4.1 1 The velocity, v (t), of the particle P’ is the

projection of the velocity 6 of the
reference particle, P.

where the negative sign shows that v (t) has a
direction opposite to the positive direction of
x—axis. Eq. (14.9) gives the instantaneous
velocity of a particle executing SHM, where
displacement is given by Eq. (14.4). We can, of
course, obtain this equation without using
geometrical argument, directly by differentiating
(Eq. 14.4) with respect of t:

v(t)=%x(t) (14.10)
The method of reference circle can be similarly
used for obtaining instantaneous acceleration
of a particle undergoing SHM. We know that the
centripetal acceleration of a particle P in uniform
circular motion has a magnitude v2/A or cozA,
and it is directed towards the centre i.e., the
direction is along P0. The instantaneous
acceleration of the projection particle P’ is then
(See Fig. 14.12)

a (t) = —a)2A cos (wt + (1))
= —a)2x(t) (14.11)

 

Fig. 1 4. 1 2 The acceleration, a(t), of the particle P’is
the projection of the acceleration a of the
reference particle P.

Eq. (14.1 1) gives the acceleration of a particle
in SHM. The same equation can again be
obtained directly by differentiating velocity v(t)
given by Eq. (14.9) with respect to time:

d
=_ (14.12)
a(t) dt v(t)

We note from Eq. (14.1 1) the important
property that acceleration of a particle in SHM
is proportional to displacement. For X(t) > O,
a(t) < 0 and for x(t) < O, a(t) > O. Thus,whatever
