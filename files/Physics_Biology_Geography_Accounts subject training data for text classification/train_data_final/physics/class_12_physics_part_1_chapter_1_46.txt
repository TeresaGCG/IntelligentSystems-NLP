electrostatic repulsion if the charge on each is 6.5 X 10“7 C? The
radii of A and B are negligible compared to the distance of
separation.
(b) What is the force of repulsion if each sphere is charged double
the above amount, and the distance between them is halved?
Suppose the spheres A and B in Exercise 1.12 have identical sizes.
A third sphere of the same size but uncharged is brought in contact
with the first, then brought in contact with the second, and finally
removed from both. What is the new force of repulsion between A
and B?
Figure 1.33 shows tracks of three charged particles in a uniform
electrostatic field. Give the signs of the three charges. Which particle
has the highest charge to mass ratio?

Consider a uniform electric field E = 3 X 103 i N/ C. (a) What is the
ﬂux of this field through a square of 10 cm on a side whose plane is
parallel to the yz plane? (b) What is the ﬂux through the same
square if the normal to its plane makes a 60° angle with the x—axis?
What is the net ﬂux of the uniform electric field of Exercise 1.15
through a cube of side 20 cm oriented so that its faces are parallel
to the coordinate planes?

Careful measurement of the electric field at the surface of a black
box indicates that the net outward ﬂux through the surface of the
box is 8.0 X 103 Nmz/ C. (a) What is the net charge inside the box?
(b) If the net outward ﬂux through the surface of the box were zero,
could you conclude that there were no charges inside the box? Why
or Why not?

A point charge +10 (1C is a distance 5 cm directly above the centre
of a square of side 10 cm, as shown in Fig. 1.34. What is the
magnitude of the electric ﬂux through the square? (Hint: Think of
the square as one face of a cube with edge 10 cm.)
