SYSTEMS OI’ PARTICLES AND ROTA'I‘IONAL MOTION

 

Eq. (7 .3 la) and (7 .3 lb) give six independent
conditions to be satisfied for mechanical
equilibrium of a rigid body. In a number of
problems all the forces acting on the body are
coplanar. Then we need only three conditions
to be satisfied for mechanical equilibrium. Two
of these conditions correspond to translational
equilibrium; the sum of the components of the
forces along any two perpendicular axes in the
plane must be zero. The third condition
corresponds to rotational equilibrium. The sum
of the components of the torques along any axis
perpendicular to the plane of the forces must
be zero.

The conditions of equilibrium of a rigid body
may be compared with those for a particle,
which we considered in earlier chapters. Since
consideration of rotational motion does not
apply to a particle, only the conditions for
translational equilibrium (Eq. 7.30 a) apply to
a particle. Thus, for equilibrium of a particle
the vector sum of all the forces on it must be
zero. Since all these forces act on the single
particle, they must be concurrent. Equilibrium
under concurrent forces was discussed in the
earlier chapters.

A body may be in partial equilibrium, i.e., it
may be in translational equilibrium and not in
rotational equilibrium, or it may be in rotational
equilibrium and not in translational
equilibrium.

Consider a light (i.e. of negligible mass) rod
(AB) as shown in Fig. 7 .20(a). At the two ends (A
and B) of which two parallel forces, both equal
in magnitude and acting along same direction
are applied perpendicular to the rod.

Fig. 7.20 (a)

Let C be the midpoint of AB, CA = CB = a.
the moment of the forces at A and B will both
be equal in magnitude (aF), but opposite in
sense as shown. The net moment on the rod will
be zero. The system will be in rotational
equilibrium, but it will not be in translational

equilibrium; 2 F 73 0

The force at B in Fig. 7 .20(a) is reversed in
Fig. 7 .20(b). Thus, we have the same rod with
two forces of equal magnitude but acting in
opposite diretions applied perpendicular to the
rod, one at end A and the other at end B. Here
the moments of both the forces are equal, but
they are not opposite; they act in the same sense
and cause anticlockwise rotation of the rod. The
total force on the body is zero; so the body is in
translational equilibrium; but it is not in
rotational equilibrium. Although the rod is not
fixed in any way, it undergoes pure rotation (i.e.
rotation without translation).

A pair of forces of equal magnitude but acting
in opposite directions with different lines of
action is known as a couple or torque. A couple
produces rotation without translation.

When we open the lid of a bottle by turning
it, our ﬁngers are applying a couple to the lid
[Fig. 7.2 1(a)]. Another known example is a
compass needle in the earth’s magnetic field as
shown in the Fig. 7 .2 l (b). The earth’s magnetic
field exerts equal forces on the north and south
poles. The force on the North Pole is towards
the north, and the force on the South Pole is
toward the south. Except when the needle points
in the north-south direction; the two forces do
not have the same line of action. Thus there is
a couple acting on the needle due to the earth’s
magnetic field.

the lid.
