Electrostatic Potential

and Capacitance

Since 6 Q’can be made as small as we like, Eq. (2.68) can be written as

1 I I2_ I2
(SW—EHQ +5Q) Q ] (2.69)

Equations (2.68) and (2.69) are identical because the term of second
order in 6 Q’, i.e., 6 Q’2/ 2C, is negligible, since 6 Q’is arbitrarily small. The
total work done (W) is the sum of the small work (6 W) over the very large
number of steps involved in building the charge Q’from zero to Q.

The same result can be obtained directly from Eq. (2.68) by integration
Q I I2 Q 2
W = Q 6Q’ = i Q I 2 Q—

This is not surprising since integration is nothing but summation of
a large number of small terms.
We can write the ﬁnal result, Eq. (2.72) in different ways

Since electrostatic force is conservative, this work is stored in the form
of potential energy of the system. For the same reason, the ﬁnal result for
potential energy [Eq. (2.73)] is independent of the manner in which the
charge configuration of the capacitor is built up. When the capacitor
discharges, this stored-up energy is released. It is possible to View the
potential energy of the capacitor as ‘stored’ in the electric field between
the plates. To see this, consider for simplicity, a parallel plate capacitor
[of area A (of each plate) and separation d between the plates].
