POINTS TO PONDER

1. Electrostatics deals with forces between charges at rest. But if there is a
force on a charge, how can it be at rest? Thus. when we are talking of
electrostatic force between charges, it should be understood that each
charge is being kept at rest by some unspecified force that opposes the
net Coulomb force on the charge.

2. A capacitor is so conﬁgured that it confines the electric ﬁeld lines within
a small region of space. Thus, even though ﬁeld may have considerable
strength, the potential difference between the two conductors of a
capacitor is small.

3. Electric ﬁeld is discontinuous across the surface of a spherical charged
shell. It is zero inside and gen outside. Electric potential is, however
continuous across the surface, equal to q/41t80R at the surface.

4. The torque p X E on a dipole causes it to oscillate about E. Only if there
is a dissipative mechanism, the oscillations are damped and the dipole
eventually aligns with E.

5. Potential due to a charge q at its own location is not defined — it is
inﬁnite.

6. In the expression qV(r) for potential energy of a charge q, V(r) is the
potential due to external charges and not the potential due to q. As seen
in point 5, this expression will be ill-deﬁned if V(r) includes potential
due to a charge q itself. 85
