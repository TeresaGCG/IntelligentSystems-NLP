Let 0 be the angle made by the string with
the vertical. When the bob is at the mean
position, 9 = 0

There are only two forces acting on the bob;
the tension T along the string and the vertical
force due to gravity (=mg). The force mg can be
resolved into the component mg cost) along the
string and mg sine perpendicular to it. Since
the motion of the bob is along a circle of length
L and centre at the support point, the bob has
a radial acceleration (wZL) and also a tangental
acceleration; the latter arises since motion along
the arc of the circle is not uniform. The radial
acceleration is provided by the net radial force
T —mg cosG, while the tangential acceleration is
provided by mg sine. It is more convenient to
work with torque about the support since the
radial force gives zero torque. Torque 1' about
the support is entirely provided by the tangental
component of force

1 = —L (mg sine) (14.22)

This is the restoring torque that tends to reduce
angular displacement — hence the negative
sign. By Newton’s law of rotational motion,

1' = ICC (14.23)

where I is the moment of inertia of the system
about the support and 0L is the angular
acceleration. Thus,

I a: —mg sin 0 L (14.24)

Or,

mgL

a = — sin6 (14.25)

 

We can simplify Eq. (14.25) if we assume that
the displacement 9 is small. We know that sin 9
can be expressed as,

sing: 0—£+i+m (14.26)

3! 5! _
where 6 is in radians.

Now if 0 is small, sin 9 can be approximated
by 0 and Eq. (14.25) can then be written as,

mgL
‘1 = —T‘9 (14.27)

In Table 14.1, we have listed the angle 9 in
degrees, its equivalent in radians, and the value

Sl-IM - how small should the amplitude be?

When you perform the experiment to
determine the time period of a simple
pendulum, your teacher tells you to keep
the amplitude small. But have you ever
asked how small is small? Should the
amplitude to 5°, 2°, 1°. or 05°? Or could it
be 10°. 20°, or 30°?

To appreciate this. it would be better to
measure the time period for different
amplitudes, up to large amplitudes. Of
course, for large oscillations, you will have
to take care that the pendulum oscillates
in a vertical plane. Let us denote the time
period for small-amplitude oscillations as
T(0) and write the time period for amplitude
00 as ’1190) = cT(0). where cis the multiplying
factor. If you plot a graph of c versus 00.
you will get values somewhat like this:

20° 45° 50° 700 90°
1.02 1.04 1.05 1.10 1.18

This means that the error in the time
period is about 2% at an amplitude of 20°.

5% at an amplitude of 50°. and 10% at an

amplitude of 70° and 18% at an amplitude
of 90°.

In the experiment. you will never be able
to measure T(0) because this means there
are no oscillations. Even theoretically,
sin 0 is exactly equal to 0 only for 6 = 0.
There will be some inaccuracy for all other
values of 0 . The difference increases with
increasing 9 . Therefore we have to decide
how much error we can tolerate. No
measurement is ever perfectly accurate.
You must also consider questions like
these: What is the accuracy of the
stopwatch? What is your own accuracy in
starting and stopping the stopwatch? You
will realise that the accuracy in your
measurements at this level is never better
than 5% or 10%. Since the above table
shows that the time period of the pendulum
increases hardly by 5% at an amplitude of
50° over its low amplitude value. you could
very well keep the amplitude to be 50° in
your experiments.
