We have already derived this equation using
the work - kinetic energy route.

7.13. 1 Conservation of angular momentum

We are now in a position to revisit the principle
of conservation of angular momentum in the
context of rotation about a fixed axis. From Eq.
(7 .45c), if the external torque is zero,

LZ = Ia) = constant (7 .46)

For symmetric bodies, from Eq. (7 .44d), Lz
may be replaced by L .(L and LZ are respectively
the magnitudes of L and L2.)

This then is the required form, for fixed axis
rotation, of Eq. (7 .29a), which expresses the
general law of conservation of angular
momentum of a system of particles. Eq. (7 .46)
applies to many situations that we come across
in daily life. You may do this experiment with
your friend. Sit on a swivel chair (a chair with a
seat, free to rotate about a pivot) with your arms
folded and feet not resting on, i.e., away from,
the ground. Ask your friend to rotate the chair
rapidly. While the chair is rotating with

considerable angular speed stretch your arms
horizontally. What happens? Your angular
speed is reduced. If you bring back your arms
closer to your body, the angular speed increases
again. This is a situation where the principle of
conservation of angular momentum is
applicable. If friction in the rotational
mechanism is neglected, there is no external
torque about the axis of rotation of the chair
and hence Ice is constant. Stretching the arms
increases I about the axis of rotation, resulting
in decreasing the angular speed a). Bringing
the arms closer to the body has the opposite
effect.

A circus acrobat and a diver take advantage
of this principle. Also, skaters and classical,
Indian or western, dancers performing a
pirouette (a spinning about a tip—top) on the toes
of one foot display ‘mastery’ over this principle.
Can you explain?

7. 14 ROLLING MOTION

One of the most common motions observed in
daily life is the rolling motion. All wheels used
in transportation have rolling motion. For
specificness we shall begin with the case of a
disc, but the result will apply to any rolling body
rolling on a level surface. We shall assume that
the disc rolls without slipping. This means that
at any instant of time the bottom of the disc
