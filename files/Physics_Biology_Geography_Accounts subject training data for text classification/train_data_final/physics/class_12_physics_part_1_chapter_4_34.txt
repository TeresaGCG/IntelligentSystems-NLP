Solution
(a) Total resistance in the circuit is,
RG +3 = 639. Hence, I = 3/63 = 0.048 A.
(b) Resistance of the galvanometer converted to an ammeter is,
RG rs _ 60 S2 x0029
RG + rs (60 +0.02)s2 z 0029
Total resistance in the circuit is,
0.029 + 39 = 3.0252. Hence, I = 3/3.02 = 0.99 A.
(c) For the ideal ammeter with zero resistance,
I = 3/3 = 1.00 A
SUMMARY

1. The total force on a charge q moving with velocity v in the presence of
magnetic and electric fields B and E, respectively is called the Lorentz
force. It is given by the expression:

F = q (v x B + E)
The magnetic force q (v X B) is normal to v and work done by it is zero.

2. A straight conductor of length l and carrying a steady current I
experiences a force F in a uniform external magnetic field B,

F = I l X B
wherelll = l and the direction of l is given by the direction of the
current.

3. In a uniform magnetic field B, a charge q executes a circular orbit in
a plane normal to B. Its frequency of uniform circular motion is called
the cyclotron frequency and is given by:

B
Vc = q
2 n m
This frequency is independent of the particle’s speed and radius. This
fact is exploited in a machine, the cyclotron, which is used to
accelerate charged particles.

4. The Biot—Savart law asserts that the magnetic field dB due to an
element d1 carrying a steady current I at a point P at a distance r from
the current element is:

#0 dl x r
dB = — I
166 47: r3
