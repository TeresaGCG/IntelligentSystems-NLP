interference. Thomas Young had expected it because he believed
in the wave theory of light.

We should mention here that the fringes are straight lines although
S1 and 82 are point sources. If we had slits instead of the point sources
(Fig. 10. 14), each pair of points would have produced straight line fringes
resulting in straight line fringes with increased intensities.

Example 10.3 Two slits are made one millimetre apart and the screen
is placed one metre away. What is the fringe separation when blue-
green light of wavelength 500 nm is used?

EXAMPLE 10.3

Example 10.4 What is the effect on the interference fringes in a
Young’s double-slit experiment due to each of the following operations:

(a) the screen is moved away from the plane of the slits;

(b) the (monochromatic) source is replaced by another
(monochromatic) source of shorter wavelength;

(0) the separation between the two slits is increased;
((1) the source slit is moved closer to the double-slit plane;
(e) the width of the source slit is increased;

(f) the monochromatic source is replaced by a source of white
light?
