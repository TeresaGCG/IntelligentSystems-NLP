defined as the position where the two forces
cancel each other exactly. If ON = r, we have

(6R — r)2 = 4r2
6R — r = :2r
r = 2R or — 6R.

The neutral point r = — 6R does not concern
us in this example. Thus ON = r = 2R. It is
sufficient to project the particle with a speed
which would enable it to reach N. Thereafter,
the greater gravitational pull of 4M would
suffice. The mechanical energy at the surface
of M is

At the neutral point N, the speed approaches
zero. The mechanical energy at N is purely

A point to note is that the speed of the projectile
is zero at N, but is nonzero when it strikes the
heavier sphere 4 M The calculation of this speed
is left as an exercise to the students.

8.9 EARTH SATELLITES

Earth satellites are objects which revolve around
the earth. Their motion is very similar to the
motion of planets around the Sun and hence
Kepler’s laws of planetary motion are equally
applicable to them. In particular, their orbits
around the earth are circular or elliptic. Moon
is the only natural satellite of the earth with a
near circular orbit with a time period of
approximately 27.3 days which is also roughly
equal to the rotational period of the moon about

its own axis. Since, 1957, advances in
technology have enabled many countries
including India to launch artificial earth
satellites for practical use in fields like
telecommunication, geophysics and
meteorology.

We will consider a satellite in a circular orbit
of a distance (RE + h) from the centre of the earth,
where RE = radius of the earth. If m is the mass
of the satellite and Vits speed, the centripetal
force required for this orbit is

mV2
F(centripetal) = —( R + h) (8.33)
E

directed towards the centre. This centripetal force
is provided by the gravitational force, which is

G m M E
F(gravitation) = m (8.34)
E

where ME is the mass of the earth.
Equating R.H.S of Eqs. (8.33) and (8.34) and
cancelling out m, we get
G M
V2 : E
—(RE +h) (8.35)

Thus V decreases as h increases. From
equation (8.35),the speed V for h = O is

V2 (h=0) = GM/RE = gRE (8.36)
where we have used the relation

g =GM/RE2. In every orbit, the satellite

traverses a distance 27t(RE+ h) with speed V. Its
time period Ttherefore is

272(RE + h) _ 27r(RE + m3”

V \fG—IVIE (8.37)

on substitution of value of V from Eq. (8.35).
Squaring both sides of Eq. (8.37), we get

T2 = k (RE+ h)3 (where k = 47172/ GME) (8.38)

which is Kepler’s law of periods, as applied to
motion of satellites around the earth. For a
satellite very close to the surface of earth h can
be neglected in comparison to RE in Eq. (8.38).
Hence, for such satellites, Tis T), where

T0 = 271'JRE /g (8.39)

If we substitute the numerical values
g : 9.8 m s2 and RE = 6400 km., we get
