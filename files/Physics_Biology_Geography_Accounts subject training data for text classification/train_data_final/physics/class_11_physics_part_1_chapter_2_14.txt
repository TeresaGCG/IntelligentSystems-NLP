insignificant digit to be dropped (the
underlined digit in this case) is more than
5, and is left unchanged if the latter is less
than 5. But what if the number is 2.745 in
which the insignificant digit is 5. Here, the
convention is that if the preceding digit is
even, the insignificant digit is simply
dropped and, if it is odd, the preceding digit
is raised by 1. Then, the number 2.74§ rounded
off to three significant figures becomes 2.74. On
the other hand, the number 2.73_5_ rounded off
to three significant ﬁgures becomes 2.74 since
the preceding digit is odd.

In any involved or complex multi-step
calculation, you should retain, in intermediate
steps, one digit more than the significant digits
and round off to proper significant figures at the
end of the calculation. Similarly, a number
known to be within many significant figures,
such as in 2.99792458 x 108 m/s for the speed
of light in vacuum, is rounded off to an
approximate value 3 x 108 m/s , which is often
employed in computations. Finally, remember
that exact numbers that appear in formulae like

’L
2 7c in T = 27: —, have a large (infinite) number
9

of significant figures. The value of 7t =
3.1415926... is known to a large number of
significant figures. You may take the value as
3.142 or 3.14 for 7c, with limited number of
significant figures as required in specific
cases.

Example 2.13 Each side of a cube is
measured to be 7.203 m. What are the

total surface area and the volume of the
cube to appropriate significant ﬁgures?

 

Answer The number of significant figures in
the measured length is 4. The calculated area
and the volume should therefore be rounded off
to 4 significant figures.

Surface area of the cube = 6(7.203)2 m2

= 3 1 1.299254 m2

= 3 1 1.3 m2

= (7 .203)3 m3

= 373.7 14754 m3

= 373.7 m3 4

Example 2.14 5.74 g of a substance

occupies 1.2 cm”. Express its density by
keeping the significant figures in View.

 

Answer There are 3 significant figures in the
measured mass whereas there are only 2
significant figures in the measured volume.
Hence the density should be expressed to only
2 significant figures.

2.7.3 Rules for Determining the Uncertainty
in the Results of Arithmatic
Calculations

The rules for determining the uncertainty or
error in the number/measured quantity in
arithmetic operations can be understood from
the following examples.

(1) If the length and breadth of a thin
rectangular sheet are measured, using a metre
scale as 16.2 cm and, 10.1 cm respectively, there
are three significant figures in each
measurement. It means that the length I may
be written as

l= 16.2 i 0.1 cm
= 16.2 cm i 0.6 %.
Similarly, the breadth b may be written as
b= 10.1 $0.1 cm
= 10.1 cm i 1 %

Then, the error of the product of two (or more)
experimental values, using the combination of
errors rule, will be

lb= 163.62 cmZ: 1.6%

= 163.62 1 2.6 cm2

This leads us to quote the final result as
lb = 164 i 3 cm2

Here 3 cm2 is the uncertainty or error in the
estimation of area of rectangular sheet.

(2) If a set of experimental data is specified
to 11 signiﬁcant ﬁgures, a result obtained by
combining the data will also be valid to n
significant ﬁgures.

However, if data are subtracted, the number of
significant figures can be reduced.
