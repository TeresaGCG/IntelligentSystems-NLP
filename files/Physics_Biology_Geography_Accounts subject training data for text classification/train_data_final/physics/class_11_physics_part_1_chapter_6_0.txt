6. 1 INTRODUCTION

The terms ‘work’, ‘energy’ and ‘power’ are frequently used
in everyday language. A farmer ploughing the field, a
construction worker carrying bricks, a student studying for
a competitive examination, an artist painting a beautiful
landscape, all are said to be working. In physics, however,
the word ‘Work’ covers a definite and precise meaning.
Somebody who has the capacity to work for 14- 16 hours a
day is said to have a large stamina or energy. We admire a
long distance runner for her stamina or energy. Energy is
thus our capacity to do work. In Physics too, the term ‘energy’
is related to work in this sense, but as said above the term
‘work’ itself is defined much more precisely. The word ‘power’
is used in everyday life with different shades of meaning. In
karate or boxing we talk of ‘powerful’ punches. These are
delivered at a great speed. This shade of meaning is close to
the meaning of the word ‘power’ used in physics. We shall
find that there is at best a loose correlation between the
physical definitions and the physiological pictures these
terms generate in our minds. The aim of this chapter is to
develop an understanding of these three physical quantities.
Before we proceed to this task, we need to develop a
mathematical prerequisite, namely the scalar product of two
vectors.

6.1.1 The Scalar Product

We have learnt about vectors and their use in Chapter 4.
Physical quantities like displacement, velocity, acceleration,
force etc. are vectors. We have also learnt how vectors are
added or subtracted. We now need to know how vectors are
multiplied. There are two ways of multiplying vectors which
we shall come across : one way known as the scalar product
gives a scalar from two vectors and the other known as the
vector product produces a new vector from two vectors. We
shall look at the vector product in Chapter 7. Here we take
up the scalar product of two vectors. The scalar product or
dot product of any two vectors A and B, denoted as A-B (read
