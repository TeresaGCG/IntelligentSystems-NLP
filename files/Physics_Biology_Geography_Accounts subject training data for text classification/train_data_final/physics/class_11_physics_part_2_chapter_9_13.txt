The graphs are drawn to the same scale.
[a] Which of the materials has the greater Young’s modulus?
[b] Which of the two is the stronger material?

9.4 Read the following two statements below carefully and state, with reasons, if it is true
or false.
(a) The Young’s modulus of rubber is greater than that of steel;
[b] The stretching of a coil is determined by its shear modulus.

9.5 Two wires of diameter 0.25 cm, one made of steel and the other made of brass are
loaded as shown in Fig. 9.13. The unloaded length of steel wire is 1.5 m and that of
brass wire is 1.0 m. Compute the elongations of the steel and the brass wires.

9.6 The edge of an aluminium cube is 10 cm long. One face of the cube is firmly fixed to a
vertical wall. A mass of 100 kg is then attached to the opposite face of the cube. The
shear modulus of aluminium is 25 GPa. What is the vertical deﬂection of this face?

9.7 Four identical hollow cylindrical columns of mild steel support a big structure of mass
50,000 kg. The inner and outer radii of each column are 30 and 60 cm respectively.
Assuming the load distribution to be uniform, calculate the compressional strain of
each column.

9.8 A piece of copper having a rectangular cross—section of 15.2 mm x 19.1 mm is pulled in
tension with 44,500 N force, producing only elastic deformation. Calculate the resulting
strain?

9.9 A steel cable with a radius of 1.5 cm supports a chairlift at a ski area. If the maximum
stress is not to exceed 108 N m’z, what is the maximum load the cable can support ?

9.10 A rigid bar of mass 15 kg is supported symmetrically by three wires each 2.0 m long.
Those at each end are of copper and the middle one is of iron. Determine the ratios of
their diameters if each is to have the same tension.

9.11 A 14.5 kg mass, fastened to the end of a steel wire of unstretched length 1.0 m, is
whirled in a vertical circle with an angular velocity of 2 rev/ s at the bottom of the circle.
The cross—sectional area of the wire is 0.065 cm2. Calculate the elongation of the wire
when the mass is at the lowest point of its path.

9.12 Compute the bulk modulus of water from the following data: Initial volume = 100.0
litre, Pressure increase = 100.0 atm (1 atm = 1.013 x 105 Pa), Final volume = 100.5
litre. Compare the bulk modulus of water with that of air (at constant temperature].
Explain in simple terms why the ratio is so large.

9.13 What is the density of water at a depth where pressure is 80.0 atm, given that its
density at the surface is 1.03 x 103 kg m3?

9. 14 Compute the fractional change in volume of a glass slab, when subjected to a hydraulic
pressure of 10 atm.

9.15 Determine the volume contraction of a solid copper cube, 10 cm on an edge, when
subjected to a hydraulic pressure of 7.0 x 106 Pa.

9. 16 How much should the pressure on a litre of water be changed to compress it by 0. 10%?
