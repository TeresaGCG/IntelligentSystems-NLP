Electrostatic Potential
and Capacitance

 

which gives

x =45cm

Thus, electric potential is zero at 9 cm and 45 cm away from the
positive charge on the side of the negative charge. Note that the
formula for potential used in the calculation required choosing
potential to be zero at infinity.

Example 2.3 Figures 2.8 (a) and (b) show the field lines of a positive
and negative point charge respectively.

FIGURE 2.8

Give the signs of the potential difference VP — VQ; VB — VA.

Give the sign of the potential energy difference of a small negative
charge between the points Q and P; A and B.

Give the sign of the work done by the field in moving a small
positive charge from Q to P.

Give the sign of the work done by the external agency in moving
a small negative charge from B to A.

Does the kinetic energy of a small negative charge increase or
decrease in going from B to A?

As V x ;, VP > VQ. Thus, (VP— V9) is positive. Also VB is less negative

than VA . Thus, VB > VA or (VB— VA) is positive.
A small negative charge will be attracted towards positive charge.
The negative charge moves from higher potential energy to lower

potential energy. Therefore the sign of potential energy difference
of a small negative charge between Q and P is positive.

Similarly, (P.E.)A > (P.E.)B and hence sign of potential energy
differences is positive.

In moving a small positive charge from Q to P, work has to be
done by an external agency against the electric field. Therefore,
work done by the field is negative.

In moving a small negative charge from B to A work has to be
done by the external agency. It is positive.

Due to force of repulsion on the negative charge, velocity decreases
and hence the kinetic energy decreases in going from B to A.
