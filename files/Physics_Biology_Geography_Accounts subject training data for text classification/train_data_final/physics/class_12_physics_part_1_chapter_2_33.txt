Potential energy stored in a system of charges is the work done [by an
external agency] in assembling the charges at their locations. Potential
energr of two charges q1, q2 at r1, r2 is given by

1
U = Q1 (12
lingo r12

 

 

where r12 is distance between q1 and q2.

The potential energy of a charge q in an external potential V[r] is qV(r).
The potential energy of a dipole moment p in a uniform electric field E is
—p.E.

Electrostatics field E is zero in the interior of a conductor; just outside
the surface of a charged conductor, E is normal to the surface given by

0'-

E = 8—“ where {1 is the unit vector along the outward normal to the
0

surface and 0' is the surface charge density. Charges in a conductor can
reside only at its surface. Potential is constant within and on the surface
of a conductor. In a cavity within a conductor [with no charges), the
electric field is zero.

A capacitor is a system of two conductors separated by an insulator. Its
capacitance is defined by C = Q/ V, where Q and —Q are the charges on the
two conductors and V is the potential difference between them. C is
determined purely geometrically, by the shapes, sizes and relative
positions of the two conductors. The unit of capacitance is faradz,
1 F = 1 C V'l. For a parallel plate capacitor (with vacuum between the
plates),

C—sA
_0_
d

where A is the area of each plate and d the separation between them.

If the medium between the plates of a capacitor is ﬁlled with an insulating
substance (dielectric), the electric field due to the charged plates induces
a net dipole moment in the dielectric. This effect, called polarisation,
gives rise to a field in the opposite direction. The net electric field inside
the dielectric and hence the potential difference between the plates is
thus reduced. Consequently, the capacitance C increases from its value
C0 when there is no medium (vacuum),

C = KCo
where K is the dielectric constant of the insulating substance.
For capacitors in the series combination, the total capacitance C is given by

In the parallel combination, the total capacitance C is:
