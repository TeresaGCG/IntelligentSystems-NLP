Example 4.12

(a) A current-carrying circular loop lies on a smooth horizontal plane.
Can a uniform magnetic field be set up in such a manner that
the loop turns around itself (i.e., turns about the vertical axis).

(b) A current-carrying circular loop is located in a uniform external
magnetic field. If the loop is free to turn, what is its orientation
of stable equilibrium? Show that in this orientation, the ﬂux of
the total field (external field + field produced by the loop) is
maximum.

(c) A loop of irregular shape carrying current is located in an external
magnetic field. If the wire is ﬂexible, why does it change to a
circular shape?

Solution

(a) No, because that would require 1: to be in the vertical direction.
But 1: = I A x B, and since A of the horizontal loop is in the vertical
direction, T would be in the plane of the loop for any B.

(b) Orientation of stable equilibrium is one where the area vector A
of the loop is in the direction of external magnetic field. In this

a orientation, the magnetic field produced by the loop is in the same

1; direction as external field, both normal to the plane of the loop,

3 thus giving rise to maximum ﬂux of the total field.

9* (c) It assumes circular shape with its plane normal to the field to

E maximise ﬂux, since for a given perimeter, a circle encloses greater

[:1 area than any other shape.
4. 10.2 Circular current loop as a magnetic dipole
In this section, we shall consider the elementary magnetic element: the
current loop. We shall show that the magnetic ﬁeld (at large distances)
due to current in a circular current loop is very similar in behaviour to
the electric field of an electric dipole. In Section 4.6, we have evaluated
the magnetic field on the axis of a circular loop, of a radius R, carrying a
steady current I. The magnitude of this ﬁeld is [(Eq. (4.15)],

#01 R2

and its direction is along the axis and given by the right-hand thumb
rule (Fig. 4.12). Here, xis the distance along the axis from the centre of
160 the loop. For x >> R, we may drop the R2 term in the denominator. Thus,
