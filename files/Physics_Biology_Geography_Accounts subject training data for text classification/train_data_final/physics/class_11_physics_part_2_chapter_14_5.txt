Finally, the quantity a) can be seen to be
related to the period of motion T. Taking, for
simplicity, ¢ = O in Eq. (14.4), we have

x(t)=Acosa)t (14.5)

Since the motion has a period T, x (t) is equal to
x (t + T). That is,

Acoswt=Acosw(t+T) (14.6)

Now the cosine function is periodic with period
27c, i.e., it first repeats itself when the argument
changes by 27c. Therefore,

a)(t+T)=a)t+21t

that is a) = 211/ T (14.7)

a) is called the angular frequency of SHM. Its
S.I. unit is radians per second. Since the
frequency of oscillations is simply 1 /T, 03 is 2%
times the frequency of oscillation. Two simple
harmonic motions may have the same A and (1),
but different a), as seen in Fig. 14.8. In this plot
the curve (b) has half the period and twice the
frequency of the curve (a).

Example 14.3 Which of the following
functions of time represent (a) simple
harmonic motion and (b) periodic but not

simple harmonic? Give the period for each
case.

(1) sin cut-cos wt

(2) sin2 Lot

Answer
(a) sin wt— cos (at

= sin wt— sin (TE/2 — (at)
= 2 cos (TE/4) sin (wt— 7c/4)
= W/2 sin (cot— 75/4)

This function represents a simple harmonic
motion having a period T = 27r/a) and a
phase angle (—7c/ 4) or (7 75/ 4)
(b) sin2 wt
= 1/2 — 1/2 cos 2 cut
The function is periodic having a period
T = n/w. It also represents a harmonic
motion with the point of equilibrium

occurring at 1/2 instead of zero. 4

14.4 SIMPLE HARMONIC MOTION AND
UNIFORM CIRCUIAR MOTION

In this section, we show that the projection of
uniform circular motion on a diameter of the
circle follows simple harmonic motion. A
simple experiment (Fig. 14.9) helps us visualise
this connection. Tie a ball to the end of a string
and make it move in a horizontal plane about
a fixed point with a constant angular speed.
The ball would then perform a uniform circular
motion in the horizontal plane. Observe the
ball sideways or from the front, fixing your
attention in the plane of motion. The ball will
appear to execute to and fro motion along a
horizontal line with the point of rotation as
the midpoint. You could alternatively observe
the shadow of the ball on a wall which is
perpendicular to the plane of the circle. In this
process what we are observing is the motion
of the ball on a diameter of the circle normal
to the direction of viewing.

 

Fig. 1 4.9 Circular motion of a ball in a plane viewed
edge—on is SHM.

Fig. 14.10 describes the same situation
mathematically. Suppose a particle P is moving
uniformly on a circle of radius A with angular
speed a). The sense of rotation is anticlockwise.
The initial position vector of the particle, i.e.,

the vector 5 at t= 0 makes an angle of q) with

the positive direction of x—axis. In time t, it will
cover a further angle cot and its position vector
