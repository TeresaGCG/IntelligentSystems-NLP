4.26 A vector has magnitude and direction. Does it have a location in space ? Can it vary
with time ? Will two equal vectors a and b at different locations in space necessarily
have identical physical effects ? Give examples in support of your answer.

4.27 A vector has both magnitude and direction. Does it mean that anything that has
magnitude and direction is necessarily a vector ? The rotation of a body can be specified
by the direction of the axis of rotation, and the angle of rotation about the axis. Does
that make any rotation a vector ?

4.28 Can you associate vectors with [a] the length of a wire bent into a loop, [b] a plane
area, [0] a sphere ? Explain.

4.29 A bullet fired at an angle of 30° with the horizontal hits the ground 3.0 km away. By
adjusting its angle of projection, can one hope to hit a target 5.0 km away ? Assume
the muzzle speed to be fixed, and neglect air resistance.

4.30 A fighter plane ﬂying horizontally at an altitude of 1.5 km with speed 720 km / h passes
directly overhead an anti—aircraft gun. At what angle from the vertical should the gun
be fired for the shell with muzzle speed 600 m s1 to hit the plane ? At what minimum
altitude should the pilot ﬂy the plane to avoid being hit ? [Take 9 = 10 m s2 ).

4.31 A cyclist is riding with a speed of 27 km/ h. As he approaches a circular turn on the
road of radius 80 m, he applies brakes and reduces his speed at the constant rate of
0.50 m / 5 every second. What is the magnitude and direction of the net acceleration of
the cyclist on the circular turn ?

4.32 [a] Show that for a projectile the angle between the velocity and the x—axis as a function
of time is given by

9(t) = tan-1[ M]

(b) Shows that the projection angle 60 for a projectile launched from the origin is
given by
90 = tan'1 [ﬂ]
