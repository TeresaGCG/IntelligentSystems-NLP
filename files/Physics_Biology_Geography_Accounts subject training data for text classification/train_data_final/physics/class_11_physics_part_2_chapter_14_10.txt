OSCILLATIONS

It follows from Eqs. (14.15) and (14.17) that
the total energy, E, of the system is,

E =U+K

= % kA2 cos2(wt + ¢) + % kA2 sin2(a)t + ¢)

= g k A2 [cos2(a)t + ¢) + sin2(a)t + m]

Using the familiar trigonometric identity, the
value of the expression in the brackets is unity.
Thus,

= l k A2 (14.18)

The total mechanical energy of a harmonic
oscillator is thus independent of time as expected
for motion under any conservative force. The
time and displacement dependence of the
potential and kinetic energies of a linear simple
harmonic oscillator are shown in
Fig. 14.16.

Fig. 1 4. 1 6 Kinetic energy, potential energy and total
energy as a function of time [shown in (a)]
and displacement [shown in (b)] of a particle
in SHM. The kinetic energy and potential
energy both repeat after a period T/ 2. The
total energy remains constant at all t or x.

Observe that both kinetic energy and
potential energy in SHM are seen to be always
positive in Fig. 14.16. Kinetic energy can, of
course, be never negative, since it is
proportional to the square of speed. Potential
energy is positive by choice of the undermined
constant in potential energy. Both kinetic
energy and potential energy peak twice during
each period of SHM. For x = 0, the energy is
kinetic; at the extremes x = iA, it is all potential
energy. In the course of motion between these
limits, kinetic energy increases at the expense
of potential energy or vice-versa.

Example 14.7 Ablock whose mass is 1 kg
is fastened to a spring. The spring has a
spring constant of 50 N m‘l. The block is
pulled to a distance x = 10 cm from its
equilibrium position at x = 0 on a frictionless

surface from rest at t = 0. Calculate the
kinetic. potential and total energies of the
block when it is 5 cm away from the mean
position.

 

Answer The block executes SHM, its angular
frequency, as given by Eq. (14.14b), is

Its displacement at any time t is then given by,
x(t) = 0.1 cos (7.07t)

Therefore, when the particle is 5 cm away from

the mean position, we have

0.05 = 0.1 cos (7.07t)

Or cos (7 .07 t) = 0.5 and hence
