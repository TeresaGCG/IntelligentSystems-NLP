equilibrium is a stable one. Any small rotation of the coil produces a
torque which brings it back to its original position. When they are
antiparallel, the equilibrium is unstable as any rotation produces a torque
which increases with the amount of rotation. The presence of this torque
is also the reason why a small magnet or any magnetic dipole aligns
itself with the external magnetic ﬁeld.

If the loop has N closely wound turns, the expression for torque, Eq.
(4.29), still holds, with

m = NIA (4.30)

Example 4.11 A 100 turn closely wound circular coil of radius 10 cm
carries a current of 3.2 A. (a) What is the field at the centre of the
coil? (b) What is the magnetic moment of this coil?

The coil is placed in a vertical plane and is free to rotate about a
horizontal axis which coincides with its diameter. A uniform magnetic
field of 2T in the horizontal direction exists such that initially the
axis of the coil is in the direction of the field. The coil rotates through
an angle of 90° under the influence of the magnetic field.
(c) What are the magnitudes of the torques on the coil in the initial
and final position? (d) What is the angular speed acquired by the
coil when it has rotated by 90°? The moment of inertia of the coil is
0.1 kg m2.

Solution

(a) From Eq. (4.16)

HONI

2R

Here, N= 100; I= 3.2 A, and R = 0.1 m. Hence,

_ 41cx10'7 ><1o2 x3,2 _ 4x10'5 x10
_ 2x10'1 ' 2x10'1
= 2 x lO‘ST
The direction is given by the right-hand thumb rule.
(b) The magnetic moment is given by Eq. (4.30),
m=NIA=NIn :2: 100 x3.2 x3.14x 10-2: ioAm2

The direction is once again given by the right-hand thumb rule.
(c) ’C = |m >< Bl [from Eq. (4.29))

Initially, 9 = 0. Thus, initial torque Tl. = 0. Finally, 9 = 15/2 (or 909).
Thus, final torque T = m B = 10 x 2 = 20 N m.
