Mechanical waves can exist in material media and are governed by Newton’s Laws.

Transverse waves are waves in which the particles of the medium oscillate perpendicular
to the direction of wave propagation.

Longitudinal waves are waves in which the particles of the medium oscillate along the
direction of wave propagation.

Progressive wave is a wave that moves from one point of medium to another.

The displacement in a sinusoidal wave propagating in the positive x direction is given
by
y (x, t) = asin [kx— cot+ (p)

where a is the amplitude of the wave, k is the angular wave number, a) is the angular
frequency, [kx — cot + 4)) is the phase, and q) is the phase constant or phase angle.

Wavelength A of a progressive wave is the distance between two consecutive points of
the same phase at a given time. In a stationary wave, it is twice the distance between
two consecutive nodes or antinodes.

Period T of oscillation of a wave is defined as the time any element of the medium
takes to move through one complete oscillation. It is related to the angular frequency a)
through the relation

Frequency v of a wave is defined as l / T and is related to angular frequency by
