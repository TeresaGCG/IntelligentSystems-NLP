Explain why

[a] The blood pressure in humans is greater at the feet than at the brain

(b) Atmospheric pressure at a height of about 6 km decreases to nearly half of
its value at the sea level, though the height of the atmosphere is more than
100 km

[c] Hydrostatic pressure is a scalar quantity even though pressure is force
divided by area.

Explain why

[a] The angle of contact of mercury with glass is obtuse, while that of water
with glass is acute.

(b) Water on a clean glass surface tends to spread out while mercury on the
same surface tends to form drops. (Put differently, water wets glass while
mercury does not.)

[c] Surface tension of a liquid is independent of the area of the surface

[d] Water with detergent disolved in it should have small angles of contact.

(e) A drop of liquid under no external forces is always spherical in shape

Fill in the blanks using the word[s) from the list appended with each statement:

[a] Surface tension of liquids generally . . . with temperatures (increases / decreases)

(b) Viscosity of gases . .. with temperature, whereas viscosity of liquids . . . with
temperature [increases / decreases]

[c] For solids with elastic modulus of rigidity, the shearing force is proportional
to , while for ﬂuids it is proportional to [shear strain / rate of shear
strain)

(d) For a ﬂuid in a steady ﬂow, the increase in ﬂow speed at a constriction follows
[conservation of mass / Bernoulli’s principle]

(e) For the model of a plane in a wind tunnel, turbulence occurs at a speed for
turbulence for an actual plane [greater / smaller]

Explain why

[a] To keep a piece of paper horizontal, you should blow over, not under, it

(b) When we try to close a water tap with our fingers, fast jets of water gush
through the openings between our fingers

[c] The size of the needle of a syringe controls ﬂow rate better than the thumb
pressure exerted by a doctor while administering an injection

[d] A ﬂuid ﬂowing out of a small hole in a vessel results in a backward thrust on
the vessel

(e) A spinning cricket ball in air does not follow a parabolic trajectory

A 50 kg girl wearing high heel shoes balances on a single heel. The heel is circular with

a diameter 1.0 cm. What is the pressure exerted by the heel on the horizontal ﬂoor ?
