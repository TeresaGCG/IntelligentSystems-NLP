SUMMARY

The ideal gas equation connecting pressure (P). volume (V) and absolute temperature
(T) is

PV= ,u. RT = k3 NT
Where ,u. is the number of moles and N is the number of molecules. R and ICE are universal
constants.

Real gases satisfy the ideal gas equation only approximately, more so at low pressures
and high temperatures.

Kinetic theory of an ideal gas gives the relation

Where n is number density of molecules, m the mass of the molecule and v2 is the

mean of squared speed. Combined with the ideal gas equation it yields a kinetic
interpretation of temperature.

This tells us that the temperature of a gas is a measure of the average kinetic energy
of a molecule. independent of the nature ofthe gas or molecule. In a mixture of gases at
a fixed temperature the heavier molecule has the lower average speed.

This leads to a relation

The law of equipartition of energy states that if a system is in equilibrium at absolute
temperature T. the total energy is distributed equally in different energy modes of
