Now, let us calculate the strength of the magnetic field. It is
E 2.9 Vm-1
B =—’"‘S=—= . ><1 ‘9T
3 ""5 c 3 x 108 m s‘1 9 6 O
a Again, since the field in the light beam is sinusoidal, the peak
-= magnetic field is B0 = ‘5 Bm = 1.4 x 10—8 T. Note that although the
E energy in the magnetic field is equal to the energy in the electric
a field, the magnetic field strength is evidently very weak.
8.4 ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM
At the time Maxwell predicted the em'stence of electromagnetic waves, the
only familiar electromagnetic waves were the visible light waves. The existence
of ultraviolet and infrared waves was barely established. By the end of the
nineteenth century, X—rays and gamma rays had also been discovered. We
3050 \ now know that, electromagnetic waves include visible light waves, X—rays,
'3; it} gamma rays, radio waves, microwaves, ultraviolet and infrared waves. The
25 E classiﬁcation of em waves according to frequency is the electromagnetic
a; spectrum (Fig. 8.5). There is no sham division between one kind of wave
E g and the next. The classiﬁcation is based roughly on how the waves are
E g g produced and / or detected.
