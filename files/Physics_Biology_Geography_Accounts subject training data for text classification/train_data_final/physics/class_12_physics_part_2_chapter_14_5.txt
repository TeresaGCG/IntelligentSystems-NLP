Nuclei

the nuclear mass M is found to be always less than this. For example, let
us consider 1:0 ; a nucleus which has 8 neutrons and 8 protons. We
have

Mass of 8 neutrons = 8 X 1.00866 u
Mass of 8 protons = 8 X 1.00727 u

Mass of 8 electrons = 8 X 0.00055 u

Therefore the expected mass of 1SO nucleus

= 8 X 2.01593 u = 16.12744 u.

The atomic mass of 1860 found from mass spectroscopy experiments
is seen to be 15.99493 u. Substracting the mass of 8 electrons (8 X 0.00055 u)
from this, we get the experimental mass of ISO nucleus to be 1 5.99053 u.

Thus, we find that the mass of the ISO nucleus is less than the total
mass of its constituents by 0.1 369 1u. The difference in mass of a nucleus
and its constituents, AM, is called the mass defect, and is given by

AM=[Zmp+(A—Z)mn]—M (13.7)

What is the meaning of the mass defect? It is here that Einstein’s
equivalence of mass and energy plays a role. Since the mass of the oxygen
nucleus is less that the sum of the masses of its constituents (8 protons
and 8 neutrons, in the unbound state), the equivalent energy of the oxygen
nucleus is less than that of the sum of the equivalent energies of its
constituents. If one wants to break the oxygen nucleus into 8 protons
and 8 neutrons, this extra energy AM c2, has to supplied. This energy
required Eb is related to the mass defect by

Eb=AMc2 (13.8)

Example 13.3 Find the energy equivalent of one atomic mass unit,
first in Joules and then in MeV. Using this, express the mass defect
of 1860 in MeV/c2.

Solution

lu = 1.6605 x 10‘27 kg

To convert it into energy units, we multiply it by c2 and find that

energy equivalent = 1.6605 X 10—27 X (2.9979 X 108)2 kg mZ/s2
= 1.4924 x 10‘10 J

1.4924x10'10
1.602x 10—19

0.9315 x 109 eV

931.5 MeV

or, 1u = 931.5 MeV/c2

For 1860, AM = 0.13691 u = 0.13691X931.5 MeV/c2
= 127.5 MeV/c2

The energy needed to separate 1860 into its constituents is thus
127.5 MeV/c2.

eV

If a certain number of neutrons and protons are brought together to
form a nucleus of a certain charge and mass, an energy Eb will be released
