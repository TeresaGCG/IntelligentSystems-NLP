Example 15.3 A steel wire 0.72 m long has
a mass of 5.0 X 10"" kg. If the wire is under

a tension of 60 N. what is the speed of
transverse waves on the wire ?

 

Answer Mass per unit length of the wire,

_ 5.O><10‘3 kg
#_ 0.72m

= 6.9 x10-3 kg m-1

Tension, T= 60 N
The speed of wave on the wire is given by

v=‘/E= —6(_)3N _1 =93ms‘1 4

15.4.2 Speed of a Longitudinal Wave
(Speed of Sound)

In a longitudinal wave, the constituents of the
medium oscillate forward and backward in the
direction of propagation of the wave. We have
already seen that the sound waves travel in the
form of compressions and rarefactions of small
volume elements of air. The elastic property that
determines the stress under compressional
strain is the bulk modulus of the medium deﬁned
by (see Chapter 9)

AV/V

Here, the change in pressure AP produces a

volumetric strain 7 . B has the same dimension

as pressure and given in SI units in terms of
pascal (Pa). The inertial property relevant for the
propagation of wave is the mass density p, with
dimensions [ML—3]. Simple inspection reveals
that quantity B/ p has the relevant dimension:

[M L‘1 T'2]
[M L’s]

Thus, if B and p are considered to be the only
relevant physical quantities,

where, as before, C is the undetermined constant
from dimensional analysis. The exact derivation
shows that C=1. Thus, the general formula for
longitudinal waves in a medium is:

v = — (15.19)

For a linear medium, like a solid bar, the
lateral expansion of the bar is negligible and we
may consider it to be only under longitudinal
strain. In that case, the relevant modulus of
elasticity is Young’s modulus, which has the
same dimension as the Bulk modulus.
Dimensional analysis for this case is the same
as before and yields a relation like Eq. (15.18).
with an undetermined C, which the exact
derivation shows to be unity. Thus, the speed of
longitudinal waves in a solid bar is given by

v = X (15.20)
p

where Y is the Young’s modulus of the material
of the bar. Table 15.1 gives the speed of sound
in some media.

Liquids and solids generally have higher speed
of sound than gases. [Note for solids, the speed
being referred to is the speed of longitudinal
waves in the solid]. This happens because they
