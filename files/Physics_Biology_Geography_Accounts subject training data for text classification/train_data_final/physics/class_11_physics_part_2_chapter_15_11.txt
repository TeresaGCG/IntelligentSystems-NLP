Fig. 15.10 The resultant of two hamonic waves of
equal amplitude and wavelength
according to the principle of superposition.
The amplitude of the resultant wave
depends on the phase difference (1), which
is zero for (a) and 71: for (b)

waves are completely, out of phase and the
resultant wave has zero displacement
everywhere at all times

y (x, t) = 0 (15.34)
Eq. (15.33) refers to the so-called constructive
interference of the two waves
where the amplitudes add up in
the resultant wave. Eq. (15.34)

intereference where the
amplitudes subtract out in the
resultant wave. Fig. 15.10
shows these two cases of
interference of waves arising
from the principle of
superposition.

WAVES

So far we considered waves

reﬂected. The phenomenon of echo is an example
of reﬂection by a rigid boundary. If the boundary
is not completely rigid or is an interface between
two different elastic media, the situation is some
what complicated. A part of the incident wave is
reﬂected and a part is transmitted into the
second medium. If a wave is incident obliquely
on the boundary between two different media
the transmitted wave is called the refracted
wave. The incident and refracted waves obey
Snell’s law of refraction, and the incident and
reflected waves obey the usual laws of
reﬂection.

Fig. 15.1 1 shows a pulse travelling along a
stretched string and being reﬂected by the
boundary. Assuming there is no absorption of
energy by the boundary, the reﬂected wave has
the same shape as the incident pulse but it
suffers a phase change of 7c or 1800 on reﬂection.
This is because the boundary is rigid and the
disturbance must have zero displacement at all
times at the boundary. By the principle of
superposition, this is possible only if the reﬂected
and incident waves differ by a phase of 7:, so that
the resultant displacement is zero. This
reasoning is based on boundary condition on a
rigid wall. We can arrive at the same conclusion
dynamically also. As the pulse arrives at the wall,
it exerts a force on the wall. By Newton’s Third
Law, the wall exerts an equal and opposite force
on the string generating a reﬂected pulse that
differs by a phase of 7c.
