Calculate the Q-values for these decays and determine that both
are energetically allowed.

Consider the fission of 233U by fast neutrons. In one fission event,

no neutrons are emitted and the final end products, after the beta

decay of the primary fragments, are 1ﬁgCe and ZZRu. Calculate Q

for this fission process. The relevant atomic and particle masses
are

m(233U) =238.05079 u
m(1§gCe) =139.90543 u

m(iiRu) = 98.90594 u
Consider the D—T reaction (deuterium—tritium fusion)

ZiH+ 31H—> 3He+n

(a) Calculate the energy released in MeV in this reaction from the
data:

m(21H )=2.014102 u

mﬁH) =3.016049 u

(b) Consider the radius of both deuterium and tritium to be
approximately 2.0 fm. What is the kinetic energy needed to
overcome the coulomb repulsion between the two nuclei? To what

temperature must the gas be heated to initiate the reaction?

(Hint: Kinetic energy required for one fusion event =average
thermal kinetic energy available with the interacting particles
= 2(316172); k = Boltzman’s constant, T = absolute temperature.)

Obtain the maximum kinetic energy of ﬁ-particles, and the radiation
frequencies of ydecays in the decay scheme shown in Fig. 13.6. You
are given that
