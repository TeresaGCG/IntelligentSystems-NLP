This clearly shows that the force due to
earth’s gravity decreases with distance. If one
assumes that the gravitational force due to the
earth decreases in proportion to the inverse
square of the distance from the centre of the

earth, we will have am ocRr‘n2 ; g on R132 and we get

—=— z 3600 (8.4)

in agreement with a value of g : 9.8 m s2 and
the value of aIn from Eq. (8.3). These observations
led Newton to propose the following Universal Law
of Gravitation :

Every body in the universe attracts every other
body with a force which is directly proportional
to the product of their masses and inversely
proportional to the square of the distance
between them.

The quotation is essentially from Newton’s
famous treatise called ‘Mathematical Principles
of Natural Philosophy’ (Principia for short).

Stated Mathematically, Newton’s gravitation
law reads : The force F on a point mass m2 due
to another point mass m1 has the magnitude

m1 m2

|F|=G r—2 (8.5)

Equation (8.5) can be expressed in vector form as

F: G ml—Zm2(—f-)=—G nil—2"“;-

T 1‘

m1 m2 ‘
— r

where G is the universal gravitational constant,

} is the unit vector from m1 to m2 and r = r2 — 1'1
as shown in Fig. 8.3.

Fig. 8.3 Gravitational force on m1 due to m2 is along
r where the vector 1' is (r2— 1-1).

The gravitational force is attractive, i.e., the
force F is along — r. The force on point mass m1
due to m2 is of course — F by Newton’s third law.
Thus, the gravitational force F12 on the body 1
due to 2 and F21 on the body 2 due to l are related
as F12 = — F21.

Before we can apply Eq. (8.5) to objects under
consideration, we have to be careful since the
law refers to point masses whereas we deal with
extended objects which have finite size. Ifwe have
a collection of point masses, the force on any
one of them is the vector sum of the gravitational
forces exerted by the other point masses as
shown in Fig 8.4.

 

Fig. 8.4 Gravitational force on point mass m1 is the
vector sum of the gravitational forces exerted

by m2, m3 and m4.

The total force on m1 is

Example 8.2 Three equal masses of 171 kg
each are fixed at the vertices of an
equilateral triangle ABC.

(a) What is the force acting on a mass 2m

placed at the centroid G of the triangle?
(b) What is the force if the mass at the
vertex A is doubled ?

Take AG = BG = CG = l m (see Fig. 8.5)

 

Answer (a) The angle between GC and the
positive x—axis is 30° and so is the angle between
GB and the negative x—axis. The individual forces
in vector notation are
