to sign and size. These can arise due to random
and unpredictable ﬂuctuations in experimental
conditions (e.g. unpredictable ﬂuctuations in
temperature, voltage supply, mechanical
vibrations of experimental set-ups, etc), personal
(unbiased) errors by the observer taking
readings, etc. For example, when the same
person repeats the same observation, it is very
likely that he may get different readings
everytime.

Least count error

The smallest value that can be measured by the
measuring instrument is called its least count.
All the readings or measured values are good only
up to this value.

The least count error is the error
associated with the resolution of the instrument.
For example, a vernier callipers has the least
count as 0.01 cm; a spherometer may have a
least count of 0.001 cm. Least count error
belongs to the category of random errors but
within a limited size; it occurs with both
systematic and random errors. If we use a metre
scale for measurement of length, it may have
graduations at 1 mm division scale spacing or
interval.

Using instruments of higher precision,
improving experimental techniques, etc., we can
reduce the least count error. Repeating the
observations several times and taking the
arithmetic mean of all the observations, the
mean value would be very close to the true value
of the measured quantity.

2.6.1 Absolute Error. Relative Error and
Percentage Error

(a) Suppose the values obtained in several
measurements are al, a2, a3...., an. The
arithmetic mean of these values is taken as
the best possible value of the quantity under
the given conditions of measurement as :

mean = (a1+a2+a3+"'+an) / n (2.4)
or,
n
am" 2 21:6” / ” (2.5)
i:

This is because, as explained earlier, it is
reasonable to suppose that individual
measurements are as likely to overestimate

as to underestimate the true value of the
quantity.

The magnitude of the difference
between the individual measurement and
the true value of the quantity is called the
absolute error of the measurement. This
is denoted by |Aa |. In absence of any other
method of knowing true value, we considered
arithmatic mean as the true value. Then the
errors in the individual measurement values
from the true value, are

= a1 — a

Aal ,

A612 = a2 — am

an’

Aa n = an. — amean

The Aa calculated above may be positive in
certain cases and negative in some other
cases. But absolute error IAaI will always

be positive.

(b) The arithmetic mean of all the absolute errors
is taken as the ﬁnal or mean absolute error
of the value of the physical quantity a. It is

represented by Aamm.
Thus,

Aamm= (IAa1|+IAa2 I+|Aa3|+,__+ 'Aanll/n
(2.6)

= Z IAail /n (2.7)
i=1

If we do a single measurement, the value we
get may be in the range amem i Aa

i.e. a=a iAa

or,

(2.8)

This implies that any measurement of the
physical quantity a is likely to lie between
(a + Aamem) and (am — Aa ).

(c) Instead of the absolute error, we often use
the relative error or the percentage error

(8a). The relative error is the ratio of the
mean absolute error Aamm to the mean
value amen" of the quantity measured.
