Mass, m = h/xlv
For an electron, mass me = h/xle ve

Now, we have v/ve = 3 and
,t/ze = 1.813 x 10‘4

A, ve
Then, mass of the particle, m = me (7] [j]

m= (9.11x1o-31 kg) x (1/3) x (1/1.813 x 104*)
m = 1.675 x 10‘27 kg.
Thus, the particle, with this mass could be a proton or a neutron.

Example 11.7 What is the de Broglie wavelength associated with an
electron, accelerated through a potential differnece of 100 volts?

Solution Accelerating potential V = 100 V. The de Broglie wavelength

A is

1 1.9 DAVISSON AND GERMER EXPERIMENT

The wave nature of electrons was ﬁrst experimentally veriﬁed by C.J.
Davisson and L.H. Germer in 1927 and independently by GP. Thomson,
in 1928, who observed

diffraction effects with beams of

electrons scattered by crystals. ‘ M7Lil' +

Germer is schematically shown
in Fig. 11.7. It consists of an
electron gun which comprises of
a tungsten filament F, coated
with barium oxide and heated
by a low voltage power supply
(L.T. or battery). Electrons

emitted by the filament are FIGURE 11.7 Davissoanermer electron
