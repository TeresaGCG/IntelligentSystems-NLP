the observer counts n crests and the observer
records the period of the wave as equal to Tgiven by

2 {1+ vs-vo ]: 0[v+vs]

The frequency v observed by the observer is
given by

v: v0 [N ”0] (15.55)
v+vS

Consider a passenger sitting in a train moving
on a straight track. Suppose she hears a whistle
sounded by the driver of the train. What
frequency will she measure or hear? Here both
the observer and the source are moving with
the same velocity, so there will be no shift in
frequency and the passenger will note the
natural frequency. But an observer outside who
is stationary with respect to the track will note
a higher frequency if the train is approaching
him and a lower frequency when it recedes
from him.

Note that we have defined the direction from
the observer to the source as the positive
direction. Therefore, if the observer is moving
towards the source, we has a positive (numerical)
value whereas if 0 is moving away from S, DC
has a negative value. On the other hand, if S is
moving away from 0, US has a positive value
whereas if it is moving towards 0, US has a
negative value. The sound emitted by the source
travels in all directions. It is that part of sound
coming towards the observer which the observer
receives and detects. Therefore, the relative
velocity of sound with respect to the observer is
v+ Do in all cases.

 

 

 

Example 15.7 A rocket is moving at a
speed of 200 m 5’1 towards a stationary
target. While moving, it emits a wave of
frequency 1000 Hz. Some of the sound

reaching the target gets reﬂected back to the
rocket as an echo. Calculate (1) the
frequency of the sound as detected by the
target and (2) the frequency of the echo as
detected by the rocket.

 

Answer (1) The observer is at rest and the
source is moving with a speed of 200 m S'l. Since
this is comparable with the velocity of sound,
330 m S'l, we must use Eq. (15.50) and not the
approximate Eq. (15.51). Since the source is
approaching a stationary target, v0 = O, and us
must be replaced by —vs. Thus, we have

—1
v
v = v0[l— Ts]

v = 1000 HZ X [1 — 200 m S'1/330 m s4]-1

: 2540 HZ

(2) The target is now the source (because it is
the source of echo) and the rocket’s detector is
now the detector or observer (because it detects
echo). Thus, vs = O and v0 has a positive value.
The frequency of the sound emitted by the source
(the target) is v, the frequency intercepted by
the target and not v0. Therefore, the frequency
as registered by the rocket is

v+v
