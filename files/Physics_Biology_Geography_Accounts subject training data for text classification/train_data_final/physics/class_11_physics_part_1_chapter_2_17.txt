UNITS AND MEASUREMENT

 

test of consistency of units, but has the
advantage that we need not commit ourselves
to a particular choice of units, and we need not
worry about conversions among multiples and
sub-multiples of the units. It may be borne in
mind that if an equation fails this consistency
test, it is proved wrong, but if it passes, it is
not proved right. Thus, a dimensionally correct
equation need not be actually an exact
(correct) equation, but a dimensionally wrong
(incorrect) or inconsistent equation must be
wrong.

Example 2.1 5 Let us consider an equation

1 2
—mv =m h
2 9

where m is the mass of the body. L' its
velocity. 9 is the acceleration due to
gravity and It is the height. Check
whether this equation is dimensionally
correct.

 

Answer The dimensions of LHS are
[M] [L '1‘1 l2 = [M] [LZ'I‘2]
= [M L2 T2]
The dimensions of RHS are
[MllL "1‘21 [L] = [MllL2 "1‘21
= [M L2'I‘2]

The dimensions of LHS and RHS are the same and
hence the equation is dimensionally correct. 4

Example 2.16 The SI unit of energy is
J = kg m2 s”: that of speed 1) is m S’1 and
of acceleration a is m S’Z. Which of the
formulae for kinetic energy (K) given below
can you rule out on the basis of
dimensional arguments (m stands for the

mass of the body) :
(a) K = m2 U"

(b) K =(1/2)mv'-'

(c) K = ma

((1) K = (3/16)mv'~’

(e) K= (1/2)mv”+ ma

 

Answer Every correct formula or equation must
have the same dimensions on both sides of the
equation. Also, only quantities with the same
physical dimensions can be added or
subtracted. The dimensions of the quantity on
the right side are [M2 L3 T3] for (a); [M L2 T2] for

33

(b) and (d); [M LT2] for (c). The quantity on the
right side of (c) has no proper dimensions since
two quantities of different dimensions have been
added. Since the kinetic energy K has the
dimensions of [M L2 T2], formulas (a), (c) and (e)
are ruled out. Note that dimensional arguments
cannot tell which of the two, (b) or (d), is the
correct formula. For this, one must turn to the
actual definition of kinetic energy (see Chapter
6). The correct formula for kinetic energy is given
by (b). 4

2.10.2 Deducing Relation among the
Physical Quantities

The method of dimensions can sometimes be
used to deduce relation among the physical
quantities. For this we should know the
dependence of the physical quantity on other
quantities (upto three physical quantities or
linearly independent variables) and consider it
as a product type of the dependence. Let us take
an example.

Example 2.1 7 Consider a simple
pendulum. having 3 bob attached to a
string. that oscillates under the action of
the force of gravity. Suppose that the period

of oscillation of the simple pendulum
depends on its length (1). mass of the bob
(m) and acceleration due to gravity (g).
Derive the expression for its time period
using method of dimensions.

 

Answer The dependence of time period T on
the quantities l, g and m as a product may be
written as :

T = k l" 914 ml
where k is dimensionless constant and x, y
and z are the exponents.

By considering dimensions on both sides, we
have

[Lo MUT1]=[L1 1x [L1 T~21y [M112

= Lx+y T—Zy Mz

On equating the dimensions on both sides,
we have

x+y=O;—2y=l;andz=0
s thtx-l -—lz-0
o a 2y 2,
Then, T= kl” g'VZ
