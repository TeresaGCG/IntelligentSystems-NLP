Solution From Eq. (4.4), we find that there is an upward force F, of
magnitude 118,. For mid-air suspension, this must be balanced by
the force due to gravity:

Solution The velocity v of particle is along the x—axis, while B, the g
magnetic field is along the y-axis, so v X B is along the z-axis (screw g

4.3 MOTION IN A MAGNETIC FIELD
We will now consider, in greater detail, the motion of a charge moving in
a magnetic ﬁeld. We have learnt in Mechanics (see ClassXI book, Chapter
6) that a force on a particle does work if the force has a component along
(or opposed to) the direction of motion of the particle. In the case of motion 137
