Figure 333 shows a potentiometer with a cell of 2.0 V and internal
resistance 0.40 S) maintaining a potential drop across the resistor
wire AB. A standard cell which maintains a constant emf of 1.02 V
(for very moderate currents upto a few mA) gives a balance point at
67.3 cm length of the wire. To ensure very low currents drawn from
the standard cell, a very high resistance of 600 k9 is put in series
with it, which is shorted close to the balance point. The standard
cell is then replaced by a cell of unknown emf 8 and the balance
point found similarly, turns out to be at 82.3 cm length of the wire.
