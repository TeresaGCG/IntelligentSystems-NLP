Maxwell Distribution Function

In a given mass of gas. the velocities of all molecules are not the same. even when bulk
parameters like pressure. volume and temperature are fixed. Collisions change the direction
and the speed of molecules. However in a state of equilibrium. the distribution of speeds is
constant. or fixed.

Distributions are very important and useful when dealing with systems containing large
number of objects. As an example consider the ages of different persons in a city. It is not
feasible to deal with the age of each individual. We can divide the people into groups: children
up to age 20 years. adults between ages of 20 and 60. old people above 60. If we want more
detailed information we can choose smaller intervals, 0- 1, 1-2 ..... 99—100 of age groups. When
the size of the interval becomes smaller, say half year, the number of persons in the interval
will also reduce. roughly half the original number in the one year interval. The number of
persons dN(x] in the age interval xand x+dx is proportional to dx or dN(x) = nv dx. We have
used nx to denote the number of persons at the value of x. I

Maxwell distribution of molecular speeds

In a similar way the molecular speed distribution gives the number of molecules between
the speeds u and 0+ dv. dN(v) = 4p N a3e’bl'2 02 do = nvdv. This is called Maxwell distribution.
The plot of n\, against v is shown in the figure. The fraction of the molecules with speeds v and
v+dv is equal to the area of the strip shown. The average of any quantity like v2 is defined by
the integral <v2> = (1 / N ) J. v2 dN(v) = \I(3kB T/ m] which agrees with the result. derived from
more elementary considerations.

Example 13.6 Uranium has two isotopes
of masses 235 and 238 units. If both are
present in Uranium hexaﬂuoride gas which
would have the larger average speed ‘? If
atomic mass of fluorine is 19 units.
estimate the percentage difference in
speeds at any temperature.
