One end of a string of length lis connected to a particle of mass m and the
other to a small peg on a smooth horizontal table. If the particle moves in a
circle with speed 1) the net force on the particle [directed towards the centre]
is :

T is the tension in the string. [Choose the correct alternative].

A constant retarding force of 50 N is applied to a body of mass 20 kg moving
initially with a speed of 15 m s‘l. How long does the body take to stop ?

A constant force acting on a body of mass 3.0 kg changes its speed from 2.0 m s‘1
to 3.5 m s‘1 in 25 s. The direction of the motion of the body remains
unchanged. What is the magnitude and direction of the force ?

A body of mass 5 kg is acted upon by two perpendicular forces 8 N and 6 N.
Give the magnitude and direction of the acceleration of the body.

The driver of a three—wheeler moving with a speed of 36 km/ h sees a child
standing in the middle of the road and brings his vehicle to rest in 4.0 s just
in time to save the child. What is the average retarding force on the vehicle ?
The mass of the three—wheeler is 400 kg and the mass of the driver is 65 kg.

A rocket with a lift—off mass 20,000 kg is blasted upwards with an initial
acceleration of 5.0 m s‘2. Calculate the initial thrust (force) of the blast.

A body of mass 0.40 kg moving initially with a constant speed of 10 m s‘1 to
the north is subject to a constant force of 8.0 N directed towards the south
for 30 s. Take the instant the force is applied to be t = 0, the position of the
body at that time to be x = 0, and predict its position at t = —5 s, 25 s, 100 s.

A truck starts from rest and accelerates uniformly at 2.0 m s’2. At t = 10 s, a
stone is dropped by a person standing on the top of the truck [6 m high from
the ground). What are the (a) velocity, and (b) acceleration of the stone at t =
l ls ? [Neglect air resistance.)

A bob of mass 0.1 kg hung from the ceiling of a room by a string 2 m long is
set into oscillation. The speed of the bob at its mean position is l m s’l.
What is the trajectory of the bob if the string is cut when the bob is [a] at one
of its extreme positions, [b] at its mean position.

A man of mass 70 kg stands on a weighing scale in a lift which is moving
(a) upwards with a uniform speed of 10 m s’l,
[b] downwards with a uniform acceleration of 5 m s2,
[c] upwards with a uniform acceleration of 5 m s’2.
What would be the readings on the scale in each case?
[d] What would be the reading if the lift mechanism failed and it hurtled
down freely under gravity ?

Figure 5.16 shows the position—time graph of a particle of mass 4 kg. What is
the [a] force on the particle for t< 0, t > 4 s, 0 < t< 4 s? [b] impulse at t = 0 and
t = 4 s ? [Consider one—dimensional motion only).

Two bodies of masses 10 kg and 20 kg respectively kept on a smooth, horizontal
surface are tied to the ends of a light string. A horizontal force F = 600 N is

applied to (i) A, [ii] B along the direction of string. What is the tension in the
string in each case?
