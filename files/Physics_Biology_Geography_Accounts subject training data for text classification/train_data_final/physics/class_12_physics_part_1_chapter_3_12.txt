Example 3.3 An electric toaster uses nichrome for its heating
element. When a negligibly small current passes through it, its
resistance at room temperature (27 .0 °C) is found to be 75.3 Q. When
the toaster is connected to a 230 V supply, the current settles, after
a few seconds, to a steady value of 2.68 A. What is the steady
temperature of the nichrome element? The temperature coefficient
of resistance of nichrome averaged over the temperature range
involved, is 1.70 X 10‘4 °C“1.

Solution When the current through the element is very small, heating
effects can be ignored and the temperature T1 of the element is the
same as room temperature. When the toaster is connected to the
supply, its initial current will be slightly higher than its steady value
of 2.68 A. But due to heating effect of the current, the temperature
will rise. This will cause an increase in resistance and a slight
decrease in current. In a few seconds, a steady state will be reached
when temperature will rise no further, and both the resistance of the
element and the current drawn will achieve steady values. The

resistance R2 at the steady temperature T2 is
230V
R2 =2.68A
Using the relation
R2=R1 [1 + a(T2—T1)]
with a = 1.70 X 10’4 °C’1, we get

TNTM =8200C H
(75.3)X1.70><10
that is, T2 = (820 + 27.0) °C = 847 °C g
Thus, the steady temperature of the heating element (when heating E
effect due to the current equals heat loss to the surroundings) is 9°
847 °C. 09
Example 3.4 The resistance of the platinum wire of a platinum
resistance thermometer at the ice point is 5 S2 and at steam point is
5.39 Q. When the thermometer is inserted in a hot bath, the resistance
of the platinum wire is 5.795 S). Calculate the temperature of the
bath.
Solution R0 = 5 9, R100 = 5.23 9 and Rt = 5.795 9
Now, t=—R‘_R° x100, Rt=Ro(1+at)
R100 — R0
