Electric Charges
and Fields

 

Solution Let the original charge on sphere A be q and that on B be
q’. At a distance r between their centres, the magnitude of the
electrostatic force on each is given by

F: 1 q?
47!?801'

 

 

neglecting the sizes of spheres A and B in comparison to r. When an
identical but uncharged sphere C touches A, the charges redistribute
on A and C and, by symmetry, each sphere carries a charge q/2.
Similarly, after D touches B, the redistributed charge on each is
q / 2. Now, if the separation between A and B is halved, the magnitude
of the electrostatic force on each is

F,= 1 (q/2)(q’/2)= 1 (qq’)=F
47:80 (r/2)2 47:80 r2

 

Thus the electrostatic force on A, due to B, remains unaltered.

1.7 FORCES BETWEEN MULTIPLE CHARGES

The mutual electric force between two charges is given
by Coulomb’s law. How to calculate the force on a
charge where there are not one but several charges
around? Consider a system of n stationary charges
q1, q2, q3, qn in vacuum. What is the force on q1 due
to q2, q3, qn? Coulomb’s law is not enough to answer
this question. Recall that forces of mechanical origin
add according to the parallelogram law of addition. Is
the same true for forces of electrostatic origin?

Experimentally, it is verified that force on any
charge due to a number of other charges is the vector
sum of all the forces on that charge due to the other
charges, taken one at a time. The individual forces
are unaffected due to the presence of other charges.
This is termed as the principle of superposition.

To better understand the concept, consider a
system of three charges q1, q2 and q3, as shown in
Fig. 1.8(a). The force on one charge, say ql, due to two
other charges q2, q3 can therefore be obtained by
performing a vector addition of the forces due to each
one of these charges. Thus, if the force on q1 due to q2
is denoted by F12, F12 is given by Eq. (1.3) even though
other charges are present.
