Solution

(a) d1 and r for each element of the straight segments are parallel.
Therefore, dl x r = 0. Straight segments do not contribute to
IBI.

(b) For all segments of the semicircular arc, dl x r are all parallel to
each other (into the plane of the paper). All such contributions
add up in magnitude. Hence direction of B for a semicircular arc
is given by the right-hand rule and magnitude is half that of a
circular loop. Thus B is 1.9 X lO‘4T normal to the plane of the
paper going into it.

(c) Same magnitude of B but opposite in direction to that in (b).

Example 4.7 Consider a tightly wound 100 turn coil of radius 10 cm,
carrying a current of l A. What is the magnitude of the magnetic
ﬁeld at the centre of the coil?

Solution Since the coil is tightly wound, we may take each circular
element to have the same radius R = 10 cm = 0.1 m. The number of
turns N = 100. The magnitude of the magnetic field is,

4.7 AMPERE’S CIRCUITAL LAW

There is an alternative and appealing way in which the Biot—Savart law
may be expressed. Ampere’s circuital law considers an open surface with
a boundary (Fig. 4.14). The surface has current passing through

it. We consider the boundary to be made up of a number of small
line elements. Consider one such element of length 011. We take
the value of the tangential component of the magnetic field, Bt, at
this element and multiply it by the length of that element dl [Note: I I
B tdl=B~d I]. All such products are added together. We consider
the limit as the lengths of elements get smaller and their number

gets larger. The sum then tends to an integral. Ampere’s law Boundary Surface
states that this integral is equal to #0 times the total current

passing through the surface, i.e.,

§B-dl = #01 [4. l7(a)]

where I is the total current through the surface. The integral is taken
over the closed loop coinciding with the boundary C of the surface. The
relation above involves a sign-convention, given by the right-hand rule.
Let the ﬁngers of the right-hand be curled in the sense the boundary is
traversed in the loop integral §B~dL Then the direction of the thumb
gives the sense in which the current I is regarded as positive.
For several applications, a much simplified version of Eq. [4. l7(a)]
proves sufficient. We shall assume that, in such cases, it is possible to
choose the loop (called an amperian loop) such that at each point of the
loop, either 147
