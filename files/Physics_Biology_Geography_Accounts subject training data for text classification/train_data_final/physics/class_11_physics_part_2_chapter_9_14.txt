9.17 Anvils made of single crystals of diamond, with the shape as shown in
Fig. 9.14, are used to investigate behaviour of materials under very high pressures. Flat
faces at the narrow end of the anvil have a diameter of 0.50 mm, and the wide ends are
subjected to a compressional force of 50,000 N. What is the pressure at the tip of the anvil?

9. 18 A rod of length 1.05 m having negligible mass is supported at its ends by two wires of
steel (wire A] and aluminium (wire B) of equal lengths as shown in
Fig. 9.15. The cross—sectional areas of wires A and B are 1.0 mm2 and 2.0 mm2,
respectively. At what point along the rod should a mass m be suspended in order to
produce [a] equal stresses and [b] equal strains in both steel and aluminium wires.

9.19 A mild steel wire of length 1.0 m and cross-sectional area 0.50 x 10'2 cm2 is
stretched, well within its elastic limit, horizontally between two pillars. A mass of 100
g is suspended from the mid—point of the wire. Calculate the depression at the mid—
point.

9.20 Two strips of metal are riveted together at their ends by four rivets, each of diameter 6.0
mm. What is the maximum tension that can be exerted by the riveted strip if the
shearing stress on the rivet is not to exceed 6.9 x 107 Pa? Assume that each rivet is to
carry one quarter of the load.

9.21 The Marina trench is located in the Pacific Ocean, and at one place it is nearly eleven
km beneath the surface of water. The water pressure at the bottom of the trench is
about 1.1 x 108 Pa. A steel ball of initial volume 0.32 m3 is dropped into the ocean and

falls to the bottom of the trench. What is the change in the volume of the ball when it
reaches to the bottom?
