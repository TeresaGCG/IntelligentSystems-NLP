induction, the laws of
electrolysis, benzene, and
the fact that the plane of
polarisation is rotated in an
electric field. He is also
credited with the invention
of the electric motor, the
electric generator and the
transformer. He is widely
regarded as the greatest
experimental scientist of
the nineteenth century.

 

 

 

The magnitude of the induced emf in a circuit is equal
to the time rate of change of magnetic ﬂux through the
circuit.

Mathematically, the induced emf is given by

_dqu

8: dt (6.3)

The negative sign indicates the direction of 8 and hence
the direction of current in a closed loop. This will be
discussed in detail in the next section.

In the case of a closely wound coil of N turns, change
of ﬂux associated with each turn, is the same. Therefore,
the expression for the total induced emf is given by

 

dqu
dt

The induced emf can be increased by increasing the
number of turns N of a closed coil.

From Eqs. (6.1) and (6.2), we see that the ﬂux can be
varied by changing any one or more of the terms B, A and
6. In Experiments 6.1 and 6.2 in Section 6.2, the ﬂux is
changed by varying B. The ﬂux can also be altered by
changing the shape of a coil (that is, by shrinking it or
stretching it) in a magnetic ﬁeld, or rotating a coil in a
magnetic field such that the angle 0 between B and A
changes. In these cases too, an emf is induced in the
respective coils.

Example 6. 1 Consider Experiment 6.2. (a) What would you do to obtain
a large deﬂection of the galvanometer? (b) How would you demonstrate
the presence of an induced current in the absence of a galvanometer?

Solution

(a) To obtain a large deﬂection, one or more of the following steps can
be taken: (i) Use a rod made of soft iron inside the coil C2, (ii) Connect
the coil to a powerful battery, and (iii) Move the arrangement rapidly
towards the test coil Cl.

(b) Replace the galvanometer by a small bulb, the kind one ﬁnds in a

EXAMPLE 6. 1

small torch light. The relative motion between the two coils will cause
the bulb to glow and thus demonstrate the presence of an induced
current.

In experimental physics one must leam to innovate. Michael Faraday
who is ranked as one of the best experimentalists ever; was legendary

for his innovative skills.

EXAMPLE 6.2

Example 6.2 A square loop of side 10 cm and resistance 0.5 Q is
placed vertically in the east-west plane. A uniform magnetic field of
0.10 T is set up across the plane in the north-east direction. The
magnetic ﬁeld is decreased to zero in 0.70 s at a steady rate. Determine
the magnitudes of induced emf and current during this time-interval.
