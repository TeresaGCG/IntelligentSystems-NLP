TABLE 1 1 . 1 WORK FUNCTIONS OF SOME METALS

 

(i) Thermionic emission: By suitably heating, sufficient thermal energy
can be imparted to the free electrons to enable them to come out of the
metal.

(ii) Field emission: By applying a very strong electric ﬁeld (of the order of
108 V m‘l) to a metal, electrons can be pulled out of the metal, as in a
spark plug.

(iii) Photoelectric emission: When light of suitable frequency illuminates
a metal surface, electrons are emitted from the metal surface. These
photo(light)-generated electrons are called photoelectrons.

1 1.3 PHOTOELECTRIC EFFECT

1 1.3.1 Hertz's observations

The phenomenon of photoelectric emission was discovered in 1887 by
Heinrich Hertz (1 857 - 1 894), during his electromagnetic wave experiments.
In his experimental investigation on the production of electromagnetic
waves by means of a spark discharge, Hertz observed that high voltage
sparks across the detector loop were enhanced when the emitter plate
was illuminated by ultraviolet light from an arc lamp.

Light shining on the metal surface somehow facilitated the escape of
free, charged particles which we now know as electrons. When light falls
on a metal surface, some electrons near the surface absorb enough energy
from the incident radiation to overcome the attraction of the positive ions
in the material of the surface. After gaining sufficient energy from the
incident light, the electrons escape from the surface of the metal into the
surrounding space.

1 1.3.2 Hallwachs’ and Lenard's observations

Wilhelm Hallwachs and Philipp Lenard investigated the phenomenon of
photoelectric emission in detail during 1886- 1902.

Lenard (1862- 1947) observed that when ultraviolet radiations were
allowed to fall on the emitter plate of an evacuated glass tube enclosing
two electrodes (metal plates), current ﬂows in the circuit (Fig. 1 1.1). As

388 soon as the ultraviolet radiations were stopped, the current ﬂow also
