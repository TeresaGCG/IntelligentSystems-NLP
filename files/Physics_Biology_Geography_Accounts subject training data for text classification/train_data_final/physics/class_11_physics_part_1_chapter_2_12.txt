PI IYSICS

the first uncertain digit are known as
signiﬁcant digits or signiﬁcant ﬁgures. If we
say the period of oscillation of a simple
pendulum is 1.62 s, the digits 1 and 6 are
reliable and certain, while the digit 2 is
uncertain. Thus, the measured value has three
significant figures. The length of an object
reported after measurement to be 287.5 cm has
four significant figures, the digits 2, 8, 7 are
certain while the digit 5 is uncertain. Clearly,
reporting the result of measurement that
includes more digits than the significant digits
is superﬂuous and also misleading since it would
give a wrong idea about the precision of
measurement.

The rules for determining the number of
significant figures can be understood from the
following examples. Significant figures indicate,
as already mentioned, the precision of
measurement which depends on the least count
of the measuring instrument. A choice of
change of different units does not change the
number of signiﬁcant digits or ﬁgures in a
measurement. This important remark makes
most of the following observations clear:

(1) For example, the length 2.308 cm has four
significant figures. But in different units, the
same value can be written as 0.02308 m or 23.08

mm or 23080 um.

All these numbers have the same number of
significant figures (digits 2, 3, 0, 8), namely four.
This shows that the location of decimal point is
of no consequence in determining the number
of significant figures.

The example gives the following rules :

0 All the non-zero digits are signiﬁcant.

0 All the zeros between two non-zero digits
are significant, no matter where the
decimal point is, if at all.

0 If the number is less than 1, the zero(s)

on the right of decimal point but to the
left of the ﬁrst non-zero digit are not
signiﬁcant. [In 0% 2308, the underlined
zeroes are not significant].

0 The terminal or trailing zero(s) in a

number without a decimal point are not
significant.
[Thus 123 m = 12300 cm = 123000 mm has
three significant figures, the trailing zero(s)
being not significant.] However, you can also
see the next observation.

0 The trailing zero(s) in a number with a
decimal point are signiﬁcant.
[The numbers 3.500 or 0.06900 have four
significant figures each.]

(2) There can be some confusion regarding the
trailing zero(s). Suppose a length is reported to
be 4.700 m. It is evident that the zeroes here
are meant to convey the precision of
measurement and are, therefore, significant. [If
these were not, it would be superﬂuous to write
them explicitly, the reported measurement
would have been simply 4.7 m]. Now suppose
we change units, then

4.700 m = 470.0 cm = 4700 mm = 0.004700 km

Since the last number has trailing zero(s) in a
number with no decimal, we would conclude
erroneously from observation (1) above that the
number has two significant figures, while in
fact, it has four significant figures and a mere
change of units cannot change the number of
significant figures.

(3) To remove such ambiguities in
determining the number of significant
figures, the best way is to report every
measurement in scientiﬁc notation (in the
power of 10). In this notation, every number is
expressed as a X 10b, where a is a number
between 1 and 10, and b is any positive or
negative exponent (or power) of 10. In order to
get an approximate idea of the number, we may
round off the number a to 1 (for a g 5) and to 10

(for 5<ag 10). Then the number can be
expressed approximately as 10b in which the
exponent (or power) b of 10 is called order of
magnitude of the physical quantity. When only
an estimate is required, the quantity is of the
order of 10’. For example, the diameter of the
earth (1.28X107m) is of the order of 107m with
the order of magnitude 7. The diameter of
hydrogen atom (1.06 x 10mm) is of the order of
10mm, with the order of magnitude
—10. Thus, the diameter of the earth is 17 orders
of magnitude larger than the hydrogen atom.

It is often customary to write the decimal after
the first digit. Now the confusion mentioned in
(a) above disappears :

4.700 m = 4.700 X 102 cm

= 4.700 X 103 mm = 4.700 X 10'3 km

The power of 10 is irrelevant to the
determination of significant figures. However, all
