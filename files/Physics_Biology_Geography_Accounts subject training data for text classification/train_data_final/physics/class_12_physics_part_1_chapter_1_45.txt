is not zero; but for distances large compared to the size of
the configuration, its field falls off faster than 1/r2, typical of field
due to a single charge. An electric dipole is the simplest example of

this fact.

EXERCISES

What is the force between two small charged spheres having
charges of 2 X 10’7C and 3 X 10’7C placed 30 cm apart in air?

The electrostatic force on a small sphere of charge 0.4 uC due to

another small sphere of charge —0.8 uC in air is 0.2 N. (a) What is

the distance between the two spheres? (b) What is the force on the

second sphere due to the first?

Check that the ratio («32/ G memp is dimensionless. Look up a Table

of Physical Constants and determine the value of this ratio. What

does the ratio signify?

(a) Explain the meaning of the statement ‘electric charge of a body
is quantised’.

(b) Why can one ignore quantisation of electric charge when dealing
with macroscopic i.e., large scale charges?

When a glass rod is rubbed with a silk cloth, charges appear on

both. A similar phenomenon is observed with many other pairs of

bodies. Explain how this observation is consistent with the law of

conservation of charge.

Four point charges qA = 2 11C, qB = —5 uC, qC = 2 uC, and qD = —5 [4C are

located at the corners of a square ABCD of side 10 cm. What is the

force on a charge of 1 (LC placed at the centre of the square?

(a) An electrostatic field line is a continuous curve. That is, a field
line cannot have sudden breaks. Why not?

(b) Explain why two field lines never cross each other at any point?

Two point charges qA = 3 (LC and qB = —3 uC are located 20 cm apart

1n vacuum.

(a) What is the electric field at the midpoint O of the line AB joining
the two charges?

(b) If a negative test charge of magnitude 1.5 X 10’9 C is placed at
this point, what is the force experienced by the test charge?

A system has two charges qA = 2.5 X 10’7 C and qB = —2.5 X 10’7 C

located at points A: (0, 0, —15 cm) and B: (0,0, +15 cm), respectively.

What are the total charge and electric dipole moment of the system?

An electric dipole with dipole moment 4 X 1059 C m is aligned at 30°
with the direction of a uniform electric ﬁeld of magnitude 5 X 104 NC’I.
Calculate the magnitude of the torque acting on the dipole.

A polythene piece rubbed with wool is found to have a negative
charge of 3 X 10*7 C.

(a) Estimate the number of electrons transferred (from which to
which?)
(b) Is there a transfer of mass from wool to polythene?

(a) Two insulated charged copper spheres A and B have their centres
separated by a distance of 50 cm. What is the mutual force of
