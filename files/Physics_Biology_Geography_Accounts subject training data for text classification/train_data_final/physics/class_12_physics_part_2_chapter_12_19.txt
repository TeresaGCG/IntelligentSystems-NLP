SUMMARY

Atom, as a whole, is electrically neutral and therefore contains equal
amount of positive and negative charges.

In Thomson’s model, an atom is a spherical cloud of positive charges
with electrons embedded in it.

In Rutherford’s model, most of the mass of the atom and all its positive
charge are concentrated in a tiny nucleus (typically one by ten thousand
the size of an atom), and the electrons revolve around it.

Rutherford nuclear model has two main difficulties in explaining the
structure of atom: [a] It predicts that atoms are unstable because the
accelerated electrons revolving around the nucleus must spiral into
the nucleus. This contradicts the stability of matter. (b) It cannot
explain the characteristic line spectra of atoms of different elements.

Atoms of each element are stable and emit characteristic spectrum.
The spectrum consists of a set of isolated parallel lines termed as line
spectrum. It provides useful information about the atomic structure.

The atomic hydrogen emits a line spectrum consisting of various series.
The frequency of any line in a series can be expressed as a difference
of two terms;

Balmer series: v: Rc[2—2——2) ; n = 3, 4. 5,...

To explain the line spectra emitted by atoms, as well as the stability
of atoms, Niel’s Bohr proposed a model for hydrogenic [single elctron]
atoms. He introduced three postulates and laid the foundations of
quantum mechanics:

[a] In a hydrogen atom, an electron revolves in certain stable orbits
[called stationary orbits] without the emission of radiant energl.

(b) The stationary orbits are those for which the angular momentum
is some integral multiple of h/2n. [Bohr’s quantisation condition.)
That is L = nh/ 2n, where n is an integer called a quantum number.

[c] The third postulate states that an electron might make a transition
from one of its specified non—radiating orbits to another of lower
energy. When it does so, a photon is emitted having energy equal
to the energy difference between the initial and final states. The
frequency (v) of the emitted photon is then given by

hv =Ei—Ef

An atom absorbs radiation of the same frequency the atom emits,
in which case the electron is transferred to an orbit with a higher
value of n.

Ei+hv = Ef
