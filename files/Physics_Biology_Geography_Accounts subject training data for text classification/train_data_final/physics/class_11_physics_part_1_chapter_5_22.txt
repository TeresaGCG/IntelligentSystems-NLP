Two masses 8 kg and 12 kg are connected at the two ends of a light inextensible
string that goes over a frictionless pulley. Find the acceleration of the masses, and
the tension in the string when the masses are released.

A nucleus is at rest in the laboratory frame of reference. Show that if it disintegrates
into two smaller nuclei the products must move in opposite directions.

Two billiard balls each of mass 0.05 kg moving in opposite directions with speed 6 m s‘1
collide and rebound with the same speed. What is the impulse imparted to each ball due
to the other ?

A shell of mass 0.020 kg is fired by a gun of mass 100 kg. If the muzzle speed of the
shell is 80 m s’l, what is the recoil speed of the gun ?

A batsman deﬂects a ball by an angle of 45° without changing its initial speed which is
equal to 54 km / h. What is the impulse imparted to the baﬂ ? (Mass of the ball is 0.15 kg.)

A stone of mass 0.25 kg tied to the end of a string is whirled round in a circle of radius

1.5 m with a speed of 40 rev. / min in a horizontal plane. What is the tension in the
string ? What is the maximum speed with which the stone can be whirled around if
the string can withstand a maximum tension of 200 N ?

If, in Exercise 5.2 1 , the speed of the stone is increased beyond the maximum permissible
value, and the string breaks suddenly, which of the following correctly describes the
trajectory of the stone after the string breaks :

(a) the stone moves radially outwards,

(b) the stone ﬂies off tangentially from the instant the string breaks,

[c] the stone ﬂies off at an angle with the tangent whose magnitude depends on the
speed of the particle ?

Explain why
[a] a horse cannot pull a cart and run in empty space,

[b] passengers are thrown forward from their seats when a speeding bus stops
suddenly,

[c] it is easier to pull a lawn mower than to push it,
[d] a cricketer moves his hands backwards while holding a catch.

Figure 5.17 shows the position—time graph of a body of mass 0.04 kg. Suggest a
suitable physical context for this motion. What is the time between two consecutive
impulses received by the body ? What is the magnitude of each impulse ?

Figure 5.18 shows a man standing stationary with respect to a horizontal conveyor
belt that is accelerating with 1 m s2. What is the net force on the man? If the
coefficient of static friction between the man’s shoes and the belt is 0.2, up to what

acceleration of the belt can the man continue to be stationary relative to the belt ?
[Mass of the man = 65 kg.)
