dominates over that due to ray optics (i.e., the size a of the aperture).
Equation (10.31) also shows that ray optics is valid in the limit of
wavelength tending to zero.

Example 10.7 For what distance is ray optics a good approximation
when the aperture is 3 mm wide and the wavelength is 500 nm?

This example shows that even with a small aperture, diffraction
spreading can be neglected for rays many metres in length. Thus, ray
optics is valid in many common situations.

10.7 POLARISATION

Consider holding a long string that is held horizontally, the other end of
which is assumed to be ﬁxed. If we move the end of the string up and
down in a periodic manner, we will generate a wave propagating in the
+x direction (Fig. 10.2 1). Such a wave could be described by the following
equation

 

—> y (X=0,t)
>

 

FIGURE 10.21 (a) The curves represent the displacement of a string at
t = 0 and at t = At. respectively when a sinusoidal wave is propagating
in the +x~direction. (b) The curve represents the time variation
of the displacement at X = 0 when a sinusoidal wave is propagating
in the +x—direction. At x = Ax. the time variation of the
displacement will be slightly displaced to the right.
