A circular coil of wire consisting of 100 turns, each of radius 8.0 cm
carries a current of 0.40 A. What is the magnitude of the magnetic
field B at the centre of the coil?

A long straight wire carries a current of 35 A. What is the magnitude
of the ﬁeld B at a point 20 cm from the wire?

A long straight wire in the horizontal plane carries a current of 50 A
in north to south direction. Give the magnitude and direction of B
at a point 2.5 m east of the wire.

A horizontal overhead power line carries a current of 90 A in east to
west direction. What is the magnitude and direction of the magnetic
field due to the current 1.5 m below the line?

What is the magnitude of magnetic force per unit length on a wire
carrying a current of 8 A and making an angle of 309 with the
direction of a uniform magnetic field of 0.15 T?

A 3.0 cm wire carrying a current of 10 A is placed inside a solenoid
perpendicular to its axis. The magnetic field inside the solenoid is
given to be 0.27 T. What is the magnetic force on the wire?

Two long and parallel straight wires A and B carrying currents of
8.0 A and 5.0 A in the same direction are separated by a distance of
4.0 cm. Estimate the force on a 10 cm section of wire A.

A closely wound solenoid 80 cm long has 5 layers of windings of 400
turns each. The diameter of the solenoid is 1.8 cm. If the current
carried is 8.0 A, estimate the magnitude of B inside the solenoid
near its centre.

A square coil of side 10 cm consists of 20 turns and carries a current
of 12 A. The coil is suspended vertically and the normal to the plane
of the coil makes an angle of 309 with the direction of a uniform
horizontal magnetic field of magnitude 0.80 T. What is the magnitude
of torque experienced by the coil?

Two moving coil meters, M1 and M2 have the following particulars:
R1 = 10 9, N1 = 30,

A1 = 3.6 x 10‘3 m2, B1 = 0.25 T

R2= 149, N2=42,

A2 = 1.8 x 10*3 m2, B2 = 0.50 T

(The spring constants are identical for the two meters).
Determine the ratio of (a) current sensitivity and (b) voltage
sensitivity of M2 and M1.

In a chamber, a uniform magnetic field of 6.5 G (1 G = 10’4 T) is
maintained. An electron is shot into the field with a speed of
4.8 X 106 m s’1 normal to the field. Explain why the path of the
electron is a circle. Determine the radius of the circular orbit.
(e = 1.5 x 10*19 c, me = 9.1x10’31 kg)

In Exercise 4.1 1 obtain the frequency of revolution of the electron in
its circular orbit. Does the answer depend on the speed of the
electron? Explain.

(a) A circular coil of 30 turns and radius 8.0 cm carrying a current
of 6.0 A is suspended vertically in a uniform horizontal magnetic
field of magnitude 1.0 T. The field lines make an angle of 60°
