Fig. 4.15 The average acceleration for three time intervals (a) Atl, [b] AtZ, and [0] M3, (At 1> At2> At3). [d] In the
limitAt —> 0, the average acceleration becomes the acceleration.

Note that in one dimension, the velocity and
the acceleration of an object are always along
the same straight line (either in the same
direction or in the opposite direction).
However, for motion in two or three
dimensions, velocity and acceleration vectors
may have any angle between 0° and 180°
between them.

} Example 4.4 The position of a particle is
given by

r = 3.0, i + 2.0th + 5.012
Where tis in seconds and the coefficients

have the proper units for r to be in metres.
(a) Find v(t) and a(t) of the particle. (b) Find
the magnitude and direction of v(t) at
t= 1.0 s.

a = 4.0 m S'2 along y- direction

At t= 1.0 s, v=3,oi+4,oj

It’s magnitude is v = J32 + 42 = 5.0 m s’1
and direction is

4.8 MOTION IN A PLANE WITH CONSTANT
ACCELERATION

Suppose that an object is moving in x-y plane
and its acceleration a is constant. Over an
interval of time, the average acceleration will
equal this constant value. Now, let the velocity
of the object be v0 at time t= O and v at time t.

Then, by definition

v — vo v — v0
t— o 2 t

Or, v 2 v0 + at (4.3321)

In terms of components :

vx = on + axt
W + ayt (4.33b)

Let us now find how the position r changes with
time. We follow the method used in the one-
dimensional case. Let rn and r be the position
vectors of the particle at time 0 and tand let the
velocities at these instants be v0 and v. Then,
over this time interval t, the average velocity is
(vn + v) / 2. The displacement is the average
velocity multiplied by the time interval :

r_ro=(v+vo)t=[(vo+at)+vo]t
