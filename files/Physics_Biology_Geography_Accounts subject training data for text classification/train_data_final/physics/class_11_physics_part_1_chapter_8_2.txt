The law of areas can be understood as a
consequence of conservation of angular
momentum whch is valid for any central force .
A central force is such that the force on the
planet is along the vector joining the Sun and
the planet. Let the Sun be at the origin and let
the position and momentum of the planet be
denoted by r and p respectively. Then the area
swept out by the planet of mass m in time

interval At is (Fig. 8.2) AA given by

AA = 1/2 (r x vAt) (8.1)
Hence
AA/At =1/2 (r x p)/m, (since v = p/m)
= L / (2 m) (8.2)

where v is the velocity, L is the angular
momentum equal to ( r x p). For a central
force, which is directed along r, L is a constant

 

Johannes Kepler
(1571-1630) was a
scientist of German
origin. He formulated
the three laws of
planetary motion based
on the painstaking
: observations of Tycho
Brahe and coworkers. Kepler himself was an
assistant to Brahe and it took him sixteen long
years to arrive at the three planetary laws. He
is also known as the founder of geometrical
optics. being the ﬁrst to describe what happens
to light after it enters a telescope.

as the planet goes around. Hence, AA /At is a

constant according to the last equation. This is
the law of areas. Gravitation is a central force
and hence the law of areas follows.

Example 8.1 Let the speed of the planet
at the perihelion Pin Fig. 8.1(a) be up and
the Sun—planet distance SP be rp. Relate

{rp. up} to the corresponding quantities at
the aphelion {rA DA}. Will the planet take
equal times to traverse BAC and CPB ?

 

Answer The magnitude of the angular
momentum at Pis L1) = up, since inspection
tells us that rp and v1) are mutually
perpendicular. Similarly, LA = mp rA DA. From
angular momentum conservation

TTIPTPUP=H1PTAUA

U_P_TA
or _ 4
DA rp

Since rA > rp, up > vA.

The area SBAC bounded by the ellipse and
the radius vectors SB and SC is larger than SBPC
in Fig. 8. 1. From Kepler’s second law, equal areas
are swept in equal times. Hence the planet will
take a longer time to traverse BAC than CPB.

8.3 UNIVERSAL LAW OF GRAVITATION

Legend has it that observing an apple falling
from a tree, Newton was inspired to arrive at an
universal law of gravitation that led to an
explanation of terrestrial gravitation as well as
of Kepler’s laws. Newton’s reasoning was that
the moon revolving in an orbit of radius Rm was
subject to a centripetal acceleration due to
earth’s gravity of magnitude

V2 4722Rm
am 2 — : 2 (8.3)
Rm T
where V is the speed of the moon related to the
time period T by the relation V = 271'Rm / T. The

time period T is about 27.3 days and Rm was
already known then to be about 3.84 X 108m. If
we substitute these numbers in Eq. (8.3), we
get a value of am much smaller than the value of
acceleration due to gravity g on the surface of
the earth, arising also due to earth’s gravitational
attraction.
