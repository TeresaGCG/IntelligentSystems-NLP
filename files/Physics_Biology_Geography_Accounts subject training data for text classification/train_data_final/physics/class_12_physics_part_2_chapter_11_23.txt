ADDITIONAL EXERCISES

(a) Estimate the speed with which electrons emitted from a heated
emitter of an evacuated tube impinge on the collector maintained
at a potential difference of 500 V with respect to the emitter.
Ignore the small initial speeds of the electrons. The

specific charge of the electron, i.e., its e/m is given to be
1.76 x 1011 C kgil.

(b) Use the same formula you employ in (a) to obtain electron speed
for an collector potential of 10 MV. Do you see what is wrong ? In
what way is the formula to be modified?

(a) A monoenergetic electron beam with electron speed of
5.20 X 106 m s’1 is subject to a magnetic ﬁeld of 1.30 X 10’4 T
normal to the beam velocity. What is the radius of the circle traced
by the beam, given 6/ m for electron equals 1.76 X 1011C kg’l.

(b) Is the formula you employ in (a) valid for calculating radius of
the path of a 20 MeV electron beam? If not, in what way is it
modified?

[Notez Exercises 11.20(b) and 11.21(b) take you to relativistic

mechanics which is beyond the scope of this book. They have been

inserted here simply to emphasise the point that the formulas you
use in part (a) of the exercises are not valid at very high speeds or

energies. See answers at the end to know what ‘very high speed or
energy’ means.]

An electron gun with its collector at a potential of 100 V fires out
electrons in a spherical bulb containing hydrogen gas at low
pressure (~10’2 mm of Hg). A magnetic field of 2.83 X 10’4 T curves
the path of the electrons in a circular orbit of radius 12.0 cm. (The
path can be viewed because the gas ions in the path focus the beam
by attracting electrons, and emitting light by electron capture; this
method is known as the ‘fine beam tube’ method.) Determine
e/ m from the data.

(a) An X-ray tube produces a continuous spectrum of radiation with
its short wavelength end at 0.45 A. What is the maximum energy
of a photon in the radiation?

(b) From your answer to (a), guess what order of accelerating voltage
(for electrons) is required in such a tube?

In an accelerator experiment on high-energy collisions of electrons
with positrons, a certain event is interpreted as annihilation of an
electron-positron pair of total energy 10.2 BeV into two y—rays of
equal energy. What is the wavelength associated with each y—ray?
(1BeV = 109 eV)

Estimating the following two numbers should be interesting. The
first number will tell you why radio engineers do not need to worry

much about photons! The second number tells you why our eye can
never ‘count photons’, even in barely detectable light.

(a) The number of photons emitted per second by a Medium wave
transmitter of 10 kW power, emitting radiowaves of wavelength
500 m.

(b) The number of photons entering the pupil of our eye per second
corresponding to the minimum intensity of white light that we
