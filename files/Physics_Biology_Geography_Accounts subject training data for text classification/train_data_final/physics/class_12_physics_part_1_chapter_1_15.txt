which again is the Coulomb force on q1 due to q3, even though other
charge q2 is present.
Thus the total force F1 on q1 due to the two charges q2 and q3 is
given as
1 - 1 q q -
F1 = F12 +F13 = qlq2 1 3

The above calculation of force can be generalised to a system of
charges more than three, as shown in Fig. 1.8(b).

The principle of superposition says that in a system of charges q1,
q2, qn, the force on q1 due to q2 is the same as given by Coulomb’s law,
i.e., it is unaffected by the presence of the other charges q3, q4, qn. The
total force F1 on the charge ql, due to all other charges, is then given by

 

 

 

 

the vector sum of the forces F12, F13, F1“:

The vector sum is obtained as usual by the parallelogram law of
addition of vectors. All of electrostatics is basically a consequence of
Coulomb’s law and the superposition principle.

Example 1.6 Consider three charges q1, q2, q3 each equal to q at the
vertices of an equilateral triangle of side I. What is the force on a
charge Q (with the same sign as q) placed at the centroid of the
triangle, as shown in Fig. 1.9?

 

FIGURE 1 .9

Solution In the given equilateral triangle ABC of sides of length I, if
we draw a perpendicular AD to the side BC,
AD = AC cos 309 = (‘5 /2) l and the distance A0 of the centroid 0
from A is (2/3) AD = (1/J§) I. By symmatry A0 = B0 = C0.
