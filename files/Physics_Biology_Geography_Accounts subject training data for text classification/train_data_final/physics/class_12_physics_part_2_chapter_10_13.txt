If x, d<<D then negligible error will be introduced if
S2P + SIP (in the denominator) is replaced by 2D. For
example, for d = 0.1 cm, D = 100 cm, OP = 1 cm (which
correspond to typical values for an interference

Thus dark and bright bands appear on the screen, as shown in
Fig. 1 0. 1 3. Such bands are called fringes. Equations (1 0. 1 8) and (10. 1 9)
show that dark and bright fringes are equally spaced and the distance
between two consecutive bright and dark fringes is given by

which is the expression for the fringe width. Obviously, the central point
O (in Fig. 10. 12) will be bright because 810 = 820 and it will correspond
to n = 0 [Eq. (10.18)]. If we consider the line perpendicular to the plane
of the paper and passing through 0 [i.e., along the y—axis] then all points
on this line will be equidistant from S1 and S2 and we will have a bright
central fringe which is a straight line as shown in Fig. 10.13. In order
to determine the shape of the interference pattern on the screen we note
that a particular fringe would correspond to the locus of points with a
constant value of SZP — SIP. Whenever this constant is an integral
multiple of 7», the fringe will be bright and whenever it is an odd integral
multiple of h/ 2 it will be a dark fringe. Now, the locus of the point P
lying in the x—y plane such that 82P — SIP (= A) is a constant, is a
hyperbola. Thus the fringe pattern will strictly be a hyperbola; however,
if the distance D is very large compared to the fringe width, the fringes
will be very nearly straight lines as shown in Fig. 10.13.
