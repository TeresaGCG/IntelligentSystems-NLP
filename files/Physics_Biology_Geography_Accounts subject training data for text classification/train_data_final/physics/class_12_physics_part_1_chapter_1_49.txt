(a) Consider an arbitrary electrostatic field configuration. A small
test charge is placed at a null point (i.e., where E = 0) of the
configuration. Show that the equilibrium of the test charge is
necessarily unstable.

(b) Verify this result for the simple configuration of two charges of
the same magnitude and sign placed a certain distance apart.

A particle of mass m and charge [—q) enters the region between the
two charged plates initially moving along x—axis with speed vx (like
particle 1 in Fig. 1.33). The length of plate is L and an uniform
electric field E is maintained between the plates. Show that the
vertical deﬂection of the particle at the far edge of the plate is
qELZ/(Zm US).

Compare this motion with motion of a projectile in gravitational ﬁeld
discussed in Section 4.10 of Class XI Textbook of Physics.

Suppose that the particle in Exercise in 1.33 is an electron projected
with velocity vx = 2.0 X 106 m s’l. If E between the plates separated

by 0.5 cm is 9.1 X 102 N/ C, where will the electron strike the upper
plate? (|e|=1.6 x 10*19 c, me = 9.1 x 10*31 kg.)
