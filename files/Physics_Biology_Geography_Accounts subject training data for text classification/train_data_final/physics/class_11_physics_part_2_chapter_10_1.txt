chest a large, light but strong wooden plank is
placed first, is saved from this accident. Such
everyday experiences convince us that both the
force and its coverage area are important. Smaller
the area on which the force acts, greater is the
impact. This impact is known as pressure.

When an object is submerged in a ﬂuid at
rest, the ﬂuid exerts a force on its surface. This
force is always normal to the object’s surface.
This is so because if there were a component of
force parallel to the surface, the object will also
exert a force on the ﬂuid parallel to it; as a
consequence of Newton’s third law. This force
will cause the ﬂuid to ﬂow parallel to the surface.
Since the ﬂuid is at rest, this cannot happen.
Hence, the force exerted by the ﬂuid at rest has
to be perpendicular to the surface in contact
with it. This is shown in Fig. 10.1(a).

The normal force exerted by the ﬂuid at a point
may be measured. An idealised form of one such
pressure-measuring device is shown in Fig.
10. 1 (b). It consists of an evacuated chamber with
a spring that is calibrated to measure the force
acting on the piston. This device is placed at a
point inside the ﬂuid. The inward force exerted
by the ﬂuid on the piston is balanced by the
outward spring force and is thereby measured.

beaker on the submerged object or on the
walls is normal (perpendicular) to the
surface at all points.

piston of area A then the average pressure Pay
is defined as the normal force acting per unit
area.

In principle, the piston area can be made
arbitrarily small. The pressure is then defined
in a limiting sense as

Pressure is a scalar quantity. We remind the
reader that it is the component of the force
normal to the area under consideration and not
the (vector) force that appears in the numerator
in Eqs. (10.1) and (10.2). Its dimensions are
[ML—1T2]. The S1 unit of pressure is N m‘2. It has
been named as pascal (Pa) in honour of the
French scientist Blaise Pascal (1623- 1662) who
carried out pioneering studies on ﬂuid pressure.
A common unit of pressure is the atmosphere
(atm), i.e. the pressure exerted by the
atmosphere at sea level (1 atm = 1.013 x 105 Pa).

Another quantity, that is indispensable in
describing ﬂuids, is the density p. For a ﬂuid of
mass m occupying volume V,

The dimensions of density are [ML—3]. Its SI
unit is kg m‘3. It is a positive scalar quantity. A
liquid is largely incompressible and its density
is therefore, nearly constant at all pressures.
Gases, on the other hand exhibit a large
variation in densities with pressure.

The density of water at 4°C (277 K) is
1.0 x 103 kg m‘3. The relative density of a
substance is the ratio of its density to the
density of water at 4°C. It is a dimensionless
positive scalar quantity. For example the relative
density of aluminium is 2.7. Its density is
2.7 x 103 kg m‘3. The densities of some common
ﬂuids are displayed in Table 10.1.
