the ﬁrst lens A (Fig. 9.2 1). The ﬁrst lens produces A ___B
an image at 11. Since image I1 is real, it serves as a
virtual object for the second lens B, producing the
ﬁnal image at I. It must, however, be borne in mind
that formation of image by the ﬁrst lens is presumed
only to facilitate determination of the position of the
ﬁnal image. In fact, the direction of rays emerging
from the ﬁrst lens gets modiﬁed in accordance with FIGURE 9-2 1 Image formation by a
the angle at which they strike thC second lens. Since combination of two thin lenses in contact.
the lenses are thin, we assume the optical centres of the lenses to be
coincident. Let this central point be denoted by P.

For the image formed by the ﬁrst lens A, we get

For the image formed by the second lens B, we get

Adding Eqs. (9.27) and (9.28), we get

If the two lens-system is regarded as equivalent to a single lens of
focal length f, we have

The derivation is valid for any number of thin lenses in contact. If
several thin lenses of focal length f1 f2, jg... are in contact, the effective
focal length of their combination is given by

In terms of power, Eq. (9.3 1) can be written as
P=P1+P2+P3+... (9.32)

where P is the net power of the lens combination. Note that the sum in
Eq. (9.32) is an algebraic sum of individual powers, so some of the terms
on the right side may be positive (for convex lenses) and some negative
(for concave lenses). Combination of lenses helps to obtain diverging or
converging lenses of desired magnification. It also enhances sharpness
of the image. Since the image formed by the ﬁrst lens becomes the object
for the second, Eq. (9.25) implies that the total magniﬁcation m of the
combination is a product of magnification (m1, m2, m3,...) of individual
lenses

m= m1 m2 m3 (9.33) 329
