The total mechanical energies E0, Eh, and EH
of the ball at the indicated heights zero (ground
level), h and H, are

‘EH = mgH (6.11 a)
l

Eh =mgh+§mv§ (6.11b)

E0 = (1/2) mvf2 (6.11 c)

The constant force is a special case of a spatially
dependent force F(x). Hence, the mechanical
energy is conserved. Thus

EH = E0

or, mgH = E mu?

vf = .12gH

a result that was obtained in section 3.7 for a
freely falling body.
Further,
EH = Eh
which implies,

v121= 29(H— h) (6.11 d)

and is a familiar result from kinematics.

At the height H, the energy is purely potential.
It is partially converted to kinetic at height h and
is fully kinetic at ground level. This illustrates
the conservation of mechanical energy.

 

b Example 6.7 Abob of mass mis suspended
by a light string of length L. It is imparted a
horizontal velocity no at the lowest point A
such that it completes a semi-circular
trajectory in the vertical plane with the string
becoming slack only on reaching the topmost
point. C. This is shown in Fig. 6.6. Obtain an
expression for (i) 00; (ii) the speeds at points
B and C: (iii) the ratio of the kinetic energies
(KB/KC) at B and C. Comment on the nature
of the trajectory of the bob after it reaches
the point C.

Answer (i) There are two external forces on
the bob : gravity and the tension (T) in the
string. The latter does no work since the
displacement of the bob is always normal to the
string. The potential energy of the bob is thus
associated with the gravitational force only. The
total mechanical energy E of the system is
conserved. We take the potential energy of the
system to be zero at the lowest point A. Thus,
at A :

E = Emvg (6.12)

TA — mg = L0 [Newton’s Second Law]

where TA is the tension in the string at A. At the
highest point C, the string slackens, as the
tension in the string (TC) becomes zero.

Thus, at C

 

 

E=émv§ +2mgL (6.13)

(ii) It is clear from Eq. (6.14)

At B, the energy is
