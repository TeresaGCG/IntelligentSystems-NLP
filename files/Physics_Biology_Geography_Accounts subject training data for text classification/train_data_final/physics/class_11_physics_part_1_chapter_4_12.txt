MOTION IN A PLANE

This relative velocity vector as shown in
Fig. 4.16 makes an angle 0 with the vertical. It is
given by

Therefore, the woman should hold her
umbrella at an angle of about 19° with the
vertical towards the west.

Note carefully the difference between this
Example and the Example 4. 1. In Example 4. 1,
the boy experiences the resultant (vector
sum) of two velocities while in this example,
the woman experiences the velocity of rain
relative to the bicycle (the vector difference
of the two velocities). 4

4. 10 PROJECTILE MOTION

As an application of the ideas developed in the
previous sections, we consider the motion of a
projectile. An object that is in ﬂight after being
thrown or projected is called a projectile. Such
a projectile might be a football, a cricket ball, a
baseball or any other object. The motion of a
projectile may be thought of as the result of two
separate, simultaneously occurring components
of motions. One component is along a horizontal
direction without any acceleration and the other
along the vertical direction with constant
acceleration due to the force of gravity. It was
Galileo who first stated this independency of the
horizontal and the vertical components of
projectile motion in his Dialogue on the great
world systems (1632).

In our discussion, we shall assume that the
air resistance has negligible effect on the motion
of the projectile. Suppose that the projectile is
launched with velocity v0 that makes an angle
00 with the x—aXis as shown in Fig. 4.17.

After the object has been projected, the
acceleration acting on it is that due to gravity
which is directed vertically downward:

a = -gJ'
Or, ax = O, ay = — g (4.36)
The components of initial velocity v0 are :
1)”: v0 cos 00
Day: vO sin 00 (4.37)

  

O :evo cos 60%- x

Fig 4. 1 7 Motion of an object prcy’ected with velocity
v0 at angle 00.

If we take the initial position to be the origin of
the reference frame as shown in Fig. 4.17, we
have :

X0: 0, y0 = 0
Then, Eq.(4.34b) becomes :

x= voxt= (vo cos 60) t
and y = (v, Sin 0,) t—(1/2)th (4.38)

The components of velocity at time t can be
obtained using Eq.(4.33b) :

v=v =vcos0
OX 0 0

vy = v0 sin 00 — g t (4.39)
Equation (4.38) gives the x—, and y-coordinates
of the position of a projectile at time tin terms of
two parameters — initial speed v0 and projection
angle 00. Notice that the choice of mutually
perpendicular x—, and y-directions for the
analysis of the projectile motion has resulted in
a simplification. One of the components of
velocity, i.e. x—component remains constant
throughout the motion and only the
y- component changes, like an object in free fall
in vertical direction. This is shown graphically
at few instants in Fig. 4. 18. Note that at the point
of maximum height, vy= O and therefore,

Equation ofpath ofa projectile

What is the shape of the path followed by the
projectile? This can be seen by eliminating the
time between the expressions for x and y as
given in Eq. (4.38). We obtain:
