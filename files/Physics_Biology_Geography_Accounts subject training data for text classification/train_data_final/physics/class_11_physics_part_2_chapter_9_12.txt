PROPERTIES OF SOLIDS

Metals have larger values of Young's modulus than alloys and elastomers. A material
with large value of Young's modulus requires a large force to produce small changes in
its length.

In daily life. we feel that a material which stretches more is more elastic. but it a is
misnomer. In fact material which stretches to a lesser extent for a given load is considered
to be more elastic.

In general. a deforming force in one direction can produce strains in other directions
also. The proportionality between stress and strain in such situations cannot be described
by just one elastic constant. For example. for a wire under longitudinal strain, the
lateral dimensions (radius of cross section) will undergo a small change. which is described
by another elastic constant of the material (called Poisson ratio).

Stress is not a vector quantity since. unlike a force. the stress cannot be assigned a
specific direction. Force acting on the portion of a body on a speciﬁed side of a section
has a deﬁnite direction.

EXERCISES

A steel wire of length 4.7 m and cross—sectional area 3.0 x 10'5 m2 stretches by the same
amount as a copper wire of length 3.5 m and cross-sectional area of 4.0 x 10'5 m2 under
a given load. What is the ratio of the Young’s modulus of steel to that of copper?

Figure 9.1 1 shows the strain—stress curve for a given material. What are (a) Young’s
modulus and (b) approximate yield strength for this material?
