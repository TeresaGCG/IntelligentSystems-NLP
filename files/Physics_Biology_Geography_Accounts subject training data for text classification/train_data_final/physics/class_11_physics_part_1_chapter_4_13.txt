Now, since 9, 60 and v0 are constants, Eq. (4.40)
is ofthe form y = ax + bx", in which aand b are
constants. This is the equation of a parabola,
i.e. the path of the projectile is a parabola
(Fig. 4.18).

 

Fig. 4. 1 8 The path of a projectile is a parabola.

Time of maximum height

How much time does the projectile take to reach
the maximum height ? Let this time be denoted
by tm. Since at this point, vy= 0, we have from

Eq. (4.39):

vy = vasinOO—g tm=0
Or, tm = v0 sinOo /g (4.41a)
The total time Tf during which the projectile is
in ﬂight can be obtained by putting y = 0 in
Eq. (4.38). We get :

Tf= 2 (v0 sin 00 )/g (4.4lb)

Tf is known as the time of ﬂight of the projectile.
We note that Tf = 2 tm , which is expected
because of the symmetry of the parabolic path.

Maximum height of a projectile

The maximum height hm reached by the
projectile can be calculated by substituting

t= tm in Eq. (4.38) :

Horizontal range of a projectile

The horizontal distance travelled by a projectile
from its initial position (x = y = 0) to the position
where it passes y = 0 during its fall is called the
horizontal range, R. It is the distance travelled
during the time of ﬂight Tf . Therefore, the range
R is
R = (we cos 60) (1})
=(vo cos 00) (2 v0 sin 60)/g

Or, R - (4.43a)

Equation (4.43a) shows that for a given
projection velocity v0, R is maximum when sin
2190 is maximum, i.e., when 90 = 45°.

The maximum horizontal range is, therefore,

Rm = — (4.43b)

Example 4. 7 Galileo. in his book Two new
sciences. stated that “for elevations which

exceed or fall short of 45" by equal
amounts, the ranges are equal". Prove this
statement.

 

Answer For a projectile launched with velocity
V" at an angle 60 , the range is given by

Now, for angles, (45° + a) and ( 45°— a), 290 is
(90° + 205) and ( 90° — 2a) , respectively. The
values of sin (90° + 2a) and sin (90° — 2a) are
the same, equal to that of cos 205. Therefore,
ranges are equal for elevations which exceed or
fall short of 45° by equal amounts at. 4

of a cliff 490 m above the ground and
throws a stone horizontally with an initial

speed of 15 m s 1. Neglecting air resistance.
find the time taken by the stone to reach
the ground, and the speed with which it
hits the ground. (Take g = 9.8 In 5‘2).
