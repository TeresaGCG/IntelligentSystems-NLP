POINTS TO PONDER

When a value is given for ac voltage or current, it is ordinarily the rms
value. The voltage across the terminals of an outlet in your room is
normally 240 V. This refers to the rms value of the voltage. The amplitude
of this voltage is

vm = JEV = @940) = 340V

The power rating of an element used in ac circuits refers to its average
power rating.

The power consumed in an ac circuit is never negative.

Both alternating current and direct current are measured in amperes.
But how is the ampere defined for an alternating current? It cannot be
derived from the mutual attraction of two parallel wires carrying ac
currents, as the dc ampere is derived. An ac current changes direction
