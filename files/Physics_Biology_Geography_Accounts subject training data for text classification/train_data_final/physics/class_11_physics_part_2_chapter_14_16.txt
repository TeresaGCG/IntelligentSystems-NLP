OSCILLATIONS

357

Of course, as expected, if we put b = 0, all
equations of a damped oscillator in this section
reduce to the corresponding equations of an
undamped oscillator.

Example 14.10 For the damped oscillator
shown in Fig. 14.19. the mass m of the block
is 200 g. k = 90 N m‘1 and the damping
constant b is 40 g 5’1. Calculate (a) the

period of oscillation. (b) time taken for its
amplitude of vibrations to drop to half of
its initial value. and (c) the time taken for
its mechanical energy to drop to half its
initial value.

 

Answer (a) We see that km = 90X0.2 = 18 kg N
m‘1 = kg2 S'2; therefore . (km = 4.243 kg 8'1, and
b = 0.04 kg S'l. Therefore, b is much less than

. (km . Hence, the time period Tfrom Eq. (14.34)
is given by

= 0.3s

(b) Now, from Eq. (14.33), the time, T for the

1/2’

amplitude to drop to half of its initial value is
given by,

_ ln(1/2)
_ b/2m

 

1/2

= 0693 x 2 x 200 s
40

 

= 6.93 s

(c) For calculating the time, t1/2, for its
mechanical energy to drop to half its initial value
we make use of Eq. (14.35). From this equation

we have,

E(t )/E(O) = exp (—bt1/2/m)

1/2

Or 1/2 = exp (—bt /m)

1/2

ln(1/2) = -(bt /m)

1/2

Or t1/2 2%x200g

= 3.46 s
This is just half of the decay period for
amplitude. This is not surprising, because,
according to Eqs. (14.33) and (14.35), energy
depends on the square of the amplitude. Notice
that there is a factor of 2 in the exponents of
the two exponentials. 4

14. 10 FORCED OSCILLATIONS
AND RESONANCE

When a system (such as a simple pendulum or
a block attached to a spring) is displaced from
its equilibrium position and released, it oscillates
with its natural frequency w, and the oscillations
are called free oscillations. All free oscillations
eventually die out because of the ever present
damping forces. However, an external agency
can maintain these oscillations. These are called
forced or driven oscillations. We consider the
case when the external force is itself periodic,
with a frequency cod called the driven frequency.
The most important fact of forced periodic
oscillations is that the system oscillates not with
its natural frequency a), but at the frequency cod
of the external agency; the free oscillations die
out due to damping. The most familiar example
of forced oscillation is when a child in a garden
swing periodically presses his feet against the
ground (or someone else periodically gives the
child a push) to maintain the oscillations.

Suppose an external force Ht) of amplitude
F0 that varies periodically with time is applied
to a damped oscillator. Such a force can be
represented as,

F(t) = F0 cos wdt (14.36)

The motion of a particle under the combined
action of a linear restoring force, damping force
and a time dependent driving force represented
by Eq. (14.36) is given by,

ma(t) =—kx(t) — bv(t) +F0 cos wdt (14.37a)

Substituting d2x/dt2 for acceleration in
Eq. (14.37a) and rearranging it, we get
