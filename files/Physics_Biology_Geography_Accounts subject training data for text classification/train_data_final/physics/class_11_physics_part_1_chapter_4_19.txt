The horizontal distance travelled by a projectile from its initial position to the position
it passes y = 0 during its fall is called the range, R of the projectile. It is :

U2

R = —° sin260
g
17. When an object follows a circular path at constant speed, the motion of the object is

called uniform circular motion. The magnitude of its acceleration is ac = v2 /R. The
direction of ac is always towards the centre of the circle.

The angular speed a). is the rate of change of angular distance. It is related to velocity
v by v = (OR. The acceleration is ac = a) 2R.

If T is the time period of revolution of the object in circular motion and v is its
frequency, we have w= 2n v, v = 27th, ac = 47t2V2R
