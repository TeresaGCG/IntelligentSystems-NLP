WHAT HAPPENS TO MY COMPASS NEEDLES AT THE POLES?

A compass needle consists of a magnetic needle which ﬂoats on a pivotal point. When the
compass is held level, it points along the direction of the horizontal component of the earth’s
magnetic ﬁeld at the location. Thus, the compass needle would stay along the magnetic
meridian of the place. In some places on the earth there are deposits of magnetic minerals
which cause the compass needle to deviate ﬁ‘om the magnetic meridian. Knowing the magnetic

declination at a place allows us to correct the compass to determine the direction of true
north.

So what happens if we take our compass to the magnetic pole? At the poles, the magnetic
ﬁeld lines are converging or diverging vertically so that the horizontal component is negligible.
If the needle is only capable of moving in a horizontal plane, it can point along any direction,
rendering it useless as a direction finder. What one needs in such a case is a dip needle
which is a compass pivoted to move in a vertical plane containing the magnetic ﬁeld of the
earth. The needle of the compass then shows the angle which the magnetic ﬁeld makes with
the vertical. At the magnetic poles such a needle will point straight down.

Example 5.9 In the magnetic meridian of a certain place, the
horizontal component of the earth’s magnetic field is 0.26G and the
dip angle is 60°. What is the magnetic field of the earth at this location?

Solution
It is given that HE = 0.26 G. From Fig. 5.11, we have
