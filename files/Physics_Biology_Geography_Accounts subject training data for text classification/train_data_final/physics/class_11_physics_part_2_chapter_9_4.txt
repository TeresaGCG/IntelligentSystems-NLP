does not obey Hooke’s law over most of the
region. Secondly, there is no well defined plastic
region. Substances like tissue of aorta, rubber
etc. which can be stretched to cause large strains
are called elastomers.

9.6 ELASTIC MODULI

The proportional region within the elastic limit
of the stress-strain curve (region 0A in Fig. 9.3)
is of great importance for structural and
manufacturing engineering designs. The ratio
of stress and strain, called modulus of elasticity,
is found to be a characteristic of the material.

9.6. 1 Young’s Modulus

Experimental observation show that for a given
material, the magnitude of the strain produced
is same whether the stress is tensile or
compressive. The ratio of tensile (or compressive)
stress (a) to the longitudinal strain (6) is deﬁned as
Young’s modulus and is denoted by the symbol Y.

O'

Y= E (9.7)

From Eqs. (9.1) and (9.2), we have

Y= (F/AJ/(AL/L)
= (Fx L) /(A x AL) (9.8)

Since strain is a dimensionless quantity, the
unit of Young’s modulus is the same as that of
stress i.e., N m—2 or Pascal (Pa). Table 9.1 gives
the values of Young’s moduli and yield strengths
of some material.

From the data given in Table 9. 1, it is noticed
that for metals Young’s moduli are large.
Therefore, these materials require a large force
to produce small change in length. To increase
the length of a thin steel wire of 0.1 cm2 cross-
sectional area by 0.1%, a force of 2000 N is
required. The force required to produce the same
strain in aluminium, brass and copper wires
having the same cross-sectional area are 690 N,
900 N and 1 100 N respectively. It means that
steel is more elastic than copper, brass and
aluminium. It is for this reason that steel is
