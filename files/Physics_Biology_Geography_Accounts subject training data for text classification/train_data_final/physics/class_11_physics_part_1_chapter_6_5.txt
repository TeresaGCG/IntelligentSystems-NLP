Fig. 6.3 (a) The shaded rectangle represents the
work done by the varying force F(x), over
the small displacement Ax, AW = FIX) Ax.
(b) adding the areas of all the rectangles we
ﬁnd that forAx a 0, the area under the curve

is exactly equal to the work done by F(x).

b Example 6.5 Awoman pushes a trunk on
a railway platform which has a rough
Surface. She applies a force of 100 N over a
distance of 10 m. Thereafter. she gets
progressively tired and her applied force
reduces linearly with distance to 50 N. The
total distance through which the trunk has
been moved is 20 m. Plot the force applied
by the woman and the frictional force, which
is 50 N versus displacement. Calculate the
work done by the two forces over 20 m.

 

 

 

Fig. 6.4 Plot of the force Fapplied by the woman and
the opposing frictional force f versus
displacement.

The plot of the applied force is shown in Fig.
6.4. At x = 20 m, F = 50 N (i 0). We are given
that the frictional force f is If I = 50 N. It opposes
motion and acts in a direction opposite to F. It
is therefore, shown on the negative side of the
force axis.

The work done by the woman is

WF—> area of the rectangle ABCD + area of
the trapezium CEID

WF = 100 x 10 + E(1oo+ 50) x 10

= 1000 + 750
: 1750J

We are now familiar with the concepts of work
and kinetic energy to prove the work-energy
theorem for a variable force. We confine
ourselves to one dimension. The time rate of
change of kinetic energy is

dK (1(1 2)
—=— —mv
dt dt 2

dv
=m—v

2F u (from Newton’s Second Law)

Thus

dK = Fdx
Integrating from the initial position (xi) to final
position ( xf), we have

Kf Xf
j dK = dex
Ki xi

where, K. and K J, are the initial and final kinetic
energies corresponding to xi and x f.

"f
or Kf - K = I Fdx (6.8a)
From Eq. (6.7), it follows that
Kf— K: = W (6.8b)

Thus, the WE theorem is proved for a variable
force.

While the WE theorem is useful in a variety of
problems, it does not, in general, incorporate the
complete dynamical information of Newton’s
second law. It is an integral form of Newton’s
second law. Newton’s second law is a relation
between acceleration and force at any instant of
time. Work-energy theorem involves an integral
over an interval of time. In this sense, the temporal
(time) information contained in the statement of
Newton’s second law is ‘integrated over’ and is
