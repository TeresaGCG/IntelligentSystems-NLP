2.3 POTENTIAL

In other words, the electrostatic potential (V)
at any point in a region with electrostatic ﬁeld is
the work done in bringing a unit positive
charge (without acceleration) from infinity to
that point.

The qualifying remarks made earlier regarding
potential energy also apply to the definition of
potential. To obtain the work done per unit test
charge, we should take an inﬁnitesimal test charge
(Sq, obtain the work done 6W in bringing it from
infinity to the point and determine the ratio
6W/6q. Also, the external force at every point of the
path is to be equal and opposite to the electrostatic
force on the test charge at that point.

DUE TO A POINT CHARGE

Consider a point charge Q at the origin (Fig. 2.3). For deﬁniteness, take Q
to be positive. We wish to determine the potential at any point P with

positive test charge from infinity to the

position vector 1' from the origin. For that we must
calculate the work done in bringing a unit positive
test charge from infinity to the point P. For Q > O,
the work done against the repulsive force on the
test charge is positive. Since work done is
independent of the path, we choose a convenient
path — along the radial direction from infinity to
the point P.

At some intermediate point P’ on the path, the
electrostatic force on a unit positive charge is

The negative sign appears because for Ar’ < 0, AW is positive. Total
