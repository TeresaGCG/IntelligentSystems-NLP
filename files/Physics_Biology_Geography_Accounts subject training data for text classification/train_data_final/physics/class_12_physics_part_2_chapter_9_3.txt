FIGURE 9.3 Focus of a concave and convex mirror.

The distance between the focus F and the pole P of the mirror is called
the focal length of the mirror, denoted by f. We now show that f = R/ 2,
where R is the radius of curvature of the mirror. The geometry
of reﬂection of an incident ray is shown in Fig. 9.4.

Let C be the centre of curvature of the mirror. Consider a
ray parallel to the principal am’s striking the mirror at M. Then
CM will be perpendicular to the mirror at M. Let 9 be the angle
of incidence, and MD be the perpendicular from M on the
principal axis. Then,

AMCP = 0 and AMFP = 20

9.2.3 The mirror equation

If rays emanating from a point actually meet at another point after
reﬂection and / or refraction, that point is called the image of the first

312 point. The image is real if the rays actually converge to the point; it is
