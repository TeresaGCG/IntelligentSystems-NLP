the resulting nuclear reactions. It is also used to implant ions into solids
and modify their properties or even synthesise new materials. It is used
in hospitals to produce radioactive substances which can be used in
diagnosis and treatment.

Example 4.4 A cyclotron’s oscillator frequency is 10 MHz. What
should be the operating magnetic field for accelerating protons? If
the radius of its ‘dees’ is 60 cm, what is the kinetic energy (in MeV) of
the proton beam produced by the accelerator.

(6 =1.60 x 10‘19 c, mp = 1.67 x 10*27 kg, 1 MeV = 1.6 x 10*13 J).

Solution The oscillator frequency should be same as proton’s
cyclotron frequency.
Using Eqs. (4.5) and [4.6(a)] we have

B = 21: m v/q =6.3 x1.67 x 10*27 x 107 / (1.6 x 10—19) = 0.66 T
Final velocity of protons is

v = rX 21: v = 0.6 m X 6.3 ><lO7 = 3.78 X 107 m/s.

E= 1/2 my2 = 1.67 x10‘27 x 14.3 x 1014 / (2 x 1.6 x 1043) = 7 MeV.

ACCELERATORS m INDIA

India has been an early entrant in the area of accelerator-based research. The vision of
Dr. Meghnath Saha created a 37 " Cyclotron in the Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics in
Kolkata in 1953. This was soon followed by a series of Cockroft—Walton type of accelerators
established in Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Mumbai, Aligarh Muslim
University (AMU), Aligarh, Bose Institute, Kolkata and Andhra University, Waltair.

The sixties saw the commissioning of a number of Van de Graaff accelerators: a 5.5 MV
terminal machine in Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC), Mumbai (1963); a 2 MV terminal
machine in Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kanpur; a 400 kV terminal machine in Banaras
Hindu University (BHU), Varanasi; and Punjabi University, Patiala. One 66 cm Cyclotron
donated by the Rochester University of USA was commissioned in Panjab University,
Chandigarh. A small electron accelerator was also established in University of Pune, Pune.

In a major initiative taken in the seventies and eighties, a Variable Energy Cyclotron was
built indigenously in Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre [VECC), Kolkata; 2 MVTandem Van
de Graaff accelerator was developed and built in BARC and a 14 MV Tandem Pelletron
accelerator was installed in TIFR.

This was soon followed by a l 5 MVTandem Pelletron established by University Grants
Commission (UGC), as an inter-university facility in Inter-University Accelerator Centre
(IUAC), New Delhi; a 3 MVTandem Pelletron in Institute of Physics, Bhubaneswar; and two
1.7 MVTandetrons inAtomic Minerals Directorate for Exploration and Research, Hyderabad
and Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research, Kalpakkam. Both TIFR and IUAC are
augmenting their facilities with the addition of superconducting LINAC modules to accelerate
the ions to higher energies.

Besides these ion accelerators, the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) has developed
many electron accelerators. A 2 GeV Synchrotron Radiation Source is being built in Raja
Ramanna Centre for Advanced Technologies, Indore.

The Department of Atomic Energy is considering Accelerator Driven Systems (ADS) for
power production and ﬁssile material breeding as future options. ‘
