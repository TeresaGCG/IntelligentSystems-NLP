where nl is the total number of turns. Thus, the self-inductance is,

 

= ,uon2Al (6.1 7)

If we ﬁll the inside of the solenoid with a material of relative permeability
yr (for example soft iron, which has a high value of relative permeability),
then,

L = ,u, #0 n2Al (6.18)

The self-inductance of the coil depends on its geometry and on the
permeability of the medium.

The self-induced emf is also called the back emf as it opposes any
change in the current in a circuit. Physically, the self-inductance plays
the role of inertia. It is the electromagnetic analogue of mass in mechanics.
So, work needs to be done against the back emf (8) in establishing the
current. This work done is stored as magnetic potential energy. For the
current I at an instant in a circuit, the rate of work done is

dW
$441

If we ignore the resistive losses and consider only inductive effect,
then using Eq. (6.16),

d_W=L [2
dt dt

Total amount of work done in establishing the current I is
I
W = j dW = I L I d1
0

Thus, the energy required to build up the current I is,

W =%L12 (6.19)

This expression reminds us of mu2 / 2 for the (mechanical) kinetic energy
of a particle of mass m, and shows that L is analogous to m (i.e., L is
electrical inertia and opposes growth and decay of current in the circuit).
Consider the general case of currents ﬂowing simultaneously in two
nearby coils. The ﬂux linked with one coil will be the sum of two ﬂuxes
which exist independently. Equation (6.9) would be modified into

N1 ¢1 : M11 11 +M12 12

where M11 represents inductance due to the same coil.
Therefore, using Faraday’s law,
