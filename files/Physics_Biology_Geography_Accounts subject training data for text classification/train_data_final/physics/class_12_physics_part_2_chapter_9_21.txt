Such a system of combination of lenses is commonly used in designing
lenses for cameras, microscopes, telescopes and other optical instruments.

Example 9.9 Find the position of the image formed by the lens
combination given in the Fig. 9.22.

The image formed by the first lens serves as the object for the second.
This is at a distance of (15 — 5) cm = 10 cm to the right of the second
lens. Though the image is real, it serves as a virtual object for the

second lens, which means that the rays appear to come from it for
the second lens.

or v2 = oo
The virtual image is formed at an infinite distance to the left of the
second lens. This acts as an object for the third lens.

9.6 REFRACTION THROUGH A PRISM

Figure 9.23 shows the passage of light through a triangular prism ABC.
The angles of incidence and refraction at the first face AB are i and r1,
while the angle of incidence (from glass to air) at the second face AC is r2
and the angle of refraction or emergence e. The angle between the

emergent ray RS and the direction of the incident ray P9 is called the

330 angle of deviation, 5.
