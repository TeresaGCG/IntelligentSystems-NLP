Pioneers of Thermodynamics

Lord Kelvin (William Thomson) (1824-1907), born in Belfast. Ireland. is
among the foremost British scientists of the nineteenth century. Thomson
played a key role in the development of the law of conservation of energy
suggested by the work of James Joule (1818—1889). Julius Mayer (1814—
1878) and Hermann Helmholtz (1821—1894). He collaborated with Joule
on the so—called Joule-Thomson effect : cooling of a gas when it expands
into vacuum. He introduced the notion of the absolute zero of temperature
and proposed the absolute temperature scale. now called the Kelvin scale
in his honour. From the work of Sadi Carnot [1796- 1832). Thomson arrived
at a form of the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Thomson was a versatile
physicist. with notable contributions to electromagnetic theory and
hydrodynamics.

Rudolf Clausius (1822-1888). born in Poland. is generally regarded as
the discoverer of the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Based on the work
of Caniot and Thomson. Clausius arrived at the important notion of entropy
that led him to a fundamental version of the Second Law of
Thermodynamics that. states that the entropy of an isolated system can
never decrease. Clausius also worked on the kinetic theory of gases and
obtained the first reliable estimates of molecular size. speed. mean free
path. etc.
