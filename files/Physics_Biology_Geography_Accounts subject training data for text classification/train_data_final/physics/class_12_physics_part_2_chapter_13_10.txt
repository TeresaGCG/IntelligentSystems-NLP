1 becquerel is simply equal to l disintegration or decay per second.
There is also another unit named “curie” that is widely used and is related
to the 81 unit as:

 

Marie Sklodowska Curie
[1867-1934) Born in
Poland. She is recognised
both as a physicist and as
a chemist. The discovery of
radioactivity by Henri
Becquerel in 1896 inspired
Marie and her husband
Pierre Curie in their
researches and analyses
which led to the isolation of
radium and polonium
elements. She was the first
person to be awarded two
Nobel Prizes- for Physics in
1903 and for Chemistry
in 191 1.

1 curie = 1 Ci = 3.7 X 1010 decays per second

= 3.7 x 1010 Bq
Different radionuclides differ greatly in their rate of
decay. A common way to characterize this feature is
through the notion of half-life. Half-life of a radionuclide
(denoted by 71/2) is the time it takes for a sample that has
initially, say NO radionuclei to reduce to NO/ 2. Putting
N= N0/2 and t= T1/2in Eq. (13.14), we get

 

_ ln2 _ 0.693
TU2 — 7 — ,1 (13.17)
Clearly if N0 reduces to half its value in time T1/2’ R0

Will also reduce to half its value in the same time according
to Eq. (13.16).

Another related measure is the average or mean life
T. This again can be obtained from Eq. (1 3.14). The
number of nuclei which decay in the time interval tto t+
At is R(t)At (= woe—“An. Each of them has lived for time
t. Thus the total life of all these nuclei would be thNoe‘7“t
At. It is clear that some nuclei may live for a short time
while others may live longer. Therefore to obtain the mean
life, we have to sum (or integrate) this expression over all
times from O to co , and divide by the total number N0 of
nuclei at t= 0. Thus,

AND I te-Mdt
O

T = —— = 1]- te‘ltdt
NO 0

One can show by performing this integral that
T = l /A
We summarise these results with the following:

_ ln2

T1/2—7 =Tln2

(13.18)

Radioactive elements (e. g., tritium, plutonium) which are short-lived
i.e., have half-lives much less than the age of the universe (~ 15 billion
years) have obviously decayed long ago and are not found in nature.
They can, however, be produced artiﬁcially in nuclear reactions.

Solution

T1/2 = 4.5 x 109y
= 4.5 X 109 y X 3.16 X 107 s/y
= 1.42 x 1017s

Example 13.4 The half-life of 238U undergoing a—decay is 4.5 X 109

92

years. What is the activity of lg sample of 235U?
