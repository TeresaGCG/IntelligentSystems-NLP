Thus, solids are the least compressible, whereas,

Gases have large compressibilities, which vary
with pressure and temperature. The
incompressibility of the solids is primarily due
to the tight coupling between the neighbouring
atoms. The molecules in liquids are also bound
with their neighbours but not as strong as in
solids. Molecules in gases are very poorly
coupled to their neighbours.

Table 9.4 shows the various types of stress,
strain, elastic moduli, and the applicable state
of matter at a glance.

Example 9.5 The average depth of Indian
Ocean is about 3000 m. Calculate the
fractional compression. AV/ V. of water at

the bottom of the ocean. given that the bulk
modulus of water is 2.2 x 109 N m‘2. (Take

9 =10 rn 5'2)

Answer The pressure exerted by a 3000 m
column of water on the bottom layer

p= hpg =3000m >< lOOOkgm'Sx 10ms‘2
= 3 x 107 kg m—1 s‘2
= 3 x 107 N m—2
Fractional compression AV/ V, is

 

gases are the most compressible. Gases are about AV/V = stress / B = (3 x 107 N m'2)/(2.2 x 109 N 111-?)
a million times more compressible than solids! = 1.36 x 10-2 or 1.36 0/0 4
