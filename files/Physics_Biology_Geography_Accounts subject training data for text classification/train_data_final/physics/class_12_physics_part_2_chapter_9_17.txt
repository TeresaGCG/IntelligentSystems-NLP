For a thin lens, BI1 = D11. Adding
Eqs. (9.17) and (9.18), we get

Suppose the object is at inﬁnity, i.e.,
OB —> co and DI =f, Eq. (9.19) gives

The point where image of an object
placed at infinity is formed is called the
focus F, of the lens and the distance f gives
its focal length. A lens has two foci, F and

F“, on either side of it (Fig. 9.19). By the

 

 

(9.20)

sign convention,
BC1 = + R1,
DC = —R

 

So Eq. (9.20) can be written as

Equation (9.21) is known as the lens
maker’s formula. It is useful to design
lenses of desired focal length using surfaces
of suitable radii of curvature. Note that the
formula is true for a concave lens also. In

Again, in the thin lens approximation, B and D are both close to the
optical centre of the lens. Applying the sign convention,
B0 = — u, D1 = +1), we get

Equation (9.23) is the familiar thin lens formula. Though we derived
it for a real image formed by a convex lens, the formula is valid for both
convex as well as concave lenses and for both real and virtual images.

It is worth mentioning that the two foci, F and F’, of a double convex
or concave lens are equidistant from the optical centre. The focus on the
side of the (original) source of light is called the ﬁrst focal point, whereas
the other is called the second focal point.

To find the image of an object by a lens, we can, in principle, take any
