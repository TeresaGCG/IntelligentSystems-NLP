EXAMPLE 8. 3

 

When the sun shines on your hand, you feel the energy being
absorbed from the electromagnetic waves (your hands get warm).
Electromagnetic waves also transfer momentum to your hand but
because 0 is very large, the amount of momentum transferred is extremely
small and you do not feel the pressure. In 1903, the American scientists
Nicols and Hull succeeded in measuring radiation pressure of
visible light and verified Eq. (8.12). It was found to be of the order of
7 X 1043 N /m2. Thus, on a surface of area 10 cm2, the force due to radiation
is only about 7 X 10‘9 N.

The great technological importance of electromagnetic waves stems
from their capability to carry energy from one place to another. The
radio and TV signals from broadcasting stations carry energy. Light

carries energy from the sun to the earth, thus making life possible on
the earth.

Example 8.2 A plane electromagnetic wave of frequency
25 MHz travels in free space along the x—direction. At a particular
point in space and time, E = 6.3 j V/m. What is B at this point?

Solution Using Eq. (8.10), the magnitude of B is

B:—
c

=w=2ixio$T
3x10 m/s

To find the direction, we note that E is along y-direction and the
wave propagates along x-axis. Therefore, B should be in a direction
perpendicular to both x- and y—axes. Using vector algebra, E X B should
be along x-direction. Since, (+3) X (+11) = i, B is along the z—direction.
Thus, B = 2.1 x 10—8 kT

Example 8.3 The magnetic field in a plane electromagnetic wave is
given by By = (2 x 10”) T sin (0.5x103x+1.5x10“t).

(a) What is the wavelength and frequency of the wave?
(b) Write an expression for the electric field.

Solution
(a) Comparing the given equation with

_ - 271: 5+1
By—Bosm l T

2a

A = —
we get 0.5x1o3 m

= 1.26 cm,

and %= V: (1.5x10“)/2n =23.9 GHz

(b) E0 = Boc = 2X10“7T x 3 x 108 m/s = 6 x 101 V/m
The electric field component is perpendicular to the direction of
propagation and the direction of magnetic field. Therefore, the
electric field component along the z-aXis is obtained as

E2 = 60 sin (0.5 x 103x + 1.5 x 1011 t) V/m
