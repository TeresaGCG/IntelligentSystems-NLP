THERMODYNAMICS

POINTS TO PONDER

1. Temperature of a body is related to its average internal energi, not to the kinetic energy
of motion of its centre of mass. A bullet ﬁred from a gun is not at a higher temperature
because of its high speed.

Equilibrium in thermodynamics refers to the situation when macroscopic variables
describing the thermodynamic state of a system do not depend on time. Equilibrium of
a system in mechanics means the net external force and torque on the system are zero.

In a state of thermodynamic equilibrium, the microscopic constituents of a system are
not in equilibrium (in the sense of mechanics).

Heat capacity, in general, depends on the process the system goes through when heat is
supplied.

In isothermal quasi-static processes, heat is absorbed or given out by the system even
though at every stage the gas has the same temperature as that of the surrounding
reservoir. This is possible because of the inﬁnitesimal difference in temperature between

the system and the reservoir.
