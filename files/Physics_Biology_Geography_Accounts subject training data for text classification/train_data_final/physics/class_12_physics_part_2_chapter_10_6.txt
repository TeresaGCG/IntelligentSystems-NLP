Wove Optics

 

any refracted wave and the wave will undergo what is known as total
internal reﬂection. The phenomenon of total internal reﬂection and its
applications was discussed in Section 9.4.

10.3.3 Reﬂection of a plane wave by a plane surface

We next consider a plane wave AB incident at an angle ion a reﬂecting
surface MN. If 0 represents the speed of the wave in the medium and if T
represents the time taken by the wavefront to advance from the point B
to C then the distance

BC= UT

In order to construct the reﬂected wavefront we draw a sphere of radius
or from the point A as shown in Fig. 10.6. Let CE represent the tangent
plane drawn from the point C to this sphere. Obviously

AE=BC=UT

AB and CE represent incident and reﬂected wavefronts.

If we now consider the triangles EAC and BAC we will find that they
are congruent and therefore, the angles iand r (as shown in Fig. 10.6)
would be equal. This is the law of reﬂection.

Once we have the laws of reﬂection and refraction, the behaviour of
prisms, lenses, and mirrors can be understood. These phenomena were
