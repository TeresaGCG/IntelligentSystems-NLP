At point C, the string becomes slack and the

velocity of the bob is horizontal and to the left. If

the connecting string is cut at this instant, the
bob will execute a projectile motion with
horizontal projection akin to a rock kicked
horizontally from the edge of a cliff. Otherwise
the bob will continue on its circular path and
complete the revolution. 4

6.9 THE POTENTIAL ENERGY OF A SPRING

The spring force is an example of a variable force
which is conservative. Fig. 6.7 shows a block
attached to a spring and resting on a smooth
horizontal surface. The other end of the spring
is attached to a rigid wall. The spring is light
and may be treated as massless. In an ideal
spring, the spring force F5 is proportional to
x where x is the displacement of the block from
the equilibrium position. The displacement could
be either positive [Fig. 6.7(b)] or negative
[Fig. 6.7(c)]. This force law for the spring is called
Hooke’s law and is mathematically stated as

a=—m

The constant k is called the spring constant. Its
unit is N m’l. The spring is said to be stiff if k is
large and soft if k is small.

Suppose that we pull the block outwards as in
Fig. 6.7 (b). Ifthe extension is xm, the work done by
the spring force is

This expression may also be obtained by
considering the area of the triangle as in
Fig. 6.7(d). Note that the work done by the
external pulling force F is positive since it
overcomes the spring force.

attached to the free end of the spring.
(a) The spring force FS is zero when the
displacement x from the equilibrium position
is zero. (b) For the stretched spring x > 0
and FS < 0 (c) For the compressed spring
x < 0 and FS > 0.(d) The plot of FS versus x.
The area of the shaded triangle represents
the work done by the spring force. Due to the
opposing signs of FS and x, this work done is

negative, Ws : —er2n / 2.

The same is true when the spring is
compressed with a displacement xC (< O). The

spring force does work WS = _ kxg /2 while the
