Electric Charges
and Fields

 

Example 1.4 Coulomb’s law for electrostatic force between two point
charges and Newton’s law for gravitational force between two
stationary point masses, both have inverse-square dependence on
the distance between the charges and masses respectively.
(a) Compare the strength of these forces by determining the ratio of
their magnitudes (i) for an electron and a proton and (ii) for two
protons. (b) Estimate the accelerations of electron and proton due to
the electrical force of their mutual attraction when they are

1 A (= 10‘10 m) apart? (mp = 1.67 x 10‘27kg, me = 9.11 x 10‘31 kg)

Solution
(a) (i) The electric force between an electron and a proton at a distance
r apart is:

 

1 62

_ 47:80 r—2

where the negative sign indicates that the force is attractive. The
corresponding gravitational force (always attractive) is:

F:

6

mp me
Fa = ‘Gr—2

where mp and me are the masses of a proton and an electron
respectively.

F 2

—6 =—e =2.4><1o39

FG 41:80Gmpme

 

 

(ii) On similar lines, the ratio of the magnitudes of electric force
to the gravitational force between two protons at a distance r

 

 

apart is:

F e2

—6 =—= 1.3 x 1036
FG 4158onme

However, it may be mentioned here that the signs of the two forces
are different. For two protons, the gravitational force is attractive
in nature and the Coulomb force is repulsive. The actual values
of these forces between two rotons inside a nucleus (distance
between two protons is ~ 10‘1 m inside a nucleus) are Fe ~ 230 N,
whereas, FG ~ 1.9 X 10‘34 N.
The (dimensionless) ratio of the two forces shows that electrical
forces are enormously stronger than the gravitational forces.
(b) The electric force F exerted by a proton on an electron is same in
magnitude to the force exerted by an electron on a proton; however,
the masses of an electron and a proton are different. Thus, the

magnitude of force is

 

1 e2
IFI = 4 —2 — 8.987 x 109 NmZ/CZX (1.6 XIO‘IQC)2 / (10—10m)2
no r
= 2.3 x 10‘8N

Using Newton’s second law of motion, F = ma, the acceleration
that an electron will undergo is

a = 2.3X10‘8N / 9.11 x10—31 kg = 2.5 x 1022m/s2

Comparing this with the value of acceleration due to gravity, we
can conclude that the effect of gravitational field is negligible on
the motion of electron and it undergoes very large accelerations
under the action of Coulomb force due to a proton.

The value for acceleration of the proton is
2.3 x 10‘8N / 1.67 x 10‘27kg = 1.4 x 1019m/s2
