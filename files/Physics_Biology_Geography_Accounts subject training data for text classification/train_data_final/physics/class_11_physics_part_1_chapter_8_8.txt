g( ) m (RE+h)2 (8.14)
This is clearly less than the value of g on the

surface of earth : 9 = R2 - For h << RE ,we can

expand the RHS of Eq. (8.14) :

GM ,2

For R—<< 1 , using binomial expression,

Equation (8.15) thus tells us that for small
heights h above the value of g decreases by a

factor (1 — 2h / RE).

Now, consider a point mass m at a depth d
below the surface of the earth (Fig. 8.8(b)), so
that its distance from the centre of the earth is

(RE — d) as shown in the figure. The earth can

be thought of as being composed of a smaller
sphere of radius (RE — d) and a spherical shell
of thickness d. The force on m due to the outer
shell of thickness d is zero because the result
quoted in the previous section. As far as the
smaller sphere of radius (RE — d ) is concerned,
the point mass is outside it and hence according
to the result quoted earlier, the force due to this
smaller sphere is just as if the entire mass of
the smaller sphere is concentrated at the centre.
If Ms is the mass of the smaller sphere, then,
Ms/ME=(RE—d)3 /RE3 (8.16)
Since mass of a sphere is proportional to be
cube of its radius.

Fig. 8.8 (b) g at a depth d. In this case only the
smaller sphere of radius (RE—d)
contributes to 9.

Thus the force on the point mass is
F(d) = GMsm/ (RE—d)2 (8.17)
Substituting for MS from above , we get
F(d) = GMEm(RE—d)/ RE3 (8.18)

and hence the acceleration due to gravity at
a depth d,

g(d)= ( )is

R —d
:9 :2 =g(1—d/RE) (8.19)

Thus, as we go down below earth’s surface,
the acceleration due gravity decreases by a factor

(l—d/RE).The remarkable thing about

acceleration due to earth’s gravity is that it is
maximum on its surface decreasing whether you
go up or down.

8.7 GRAVITATIONAL POTENTIAL ENERGY

We had discussed earlier the notion of potential
energy as being the energy stored in the body at
its given position. If the position of the particle
changes on account of forces acting on it, then
the change in its potential energy is just the
amount of work done on the body by the force.
As we had discussed earlier, forces for which
the work done is independent of the path are
the conservative forces.

The force of gravity is a conservative force
and we can calculate the potential energy of a
body arising out of this force, called the
gravitational potential energy. Consider points
close to the surface of earth, at distances from
the surface much smaller than the radius of the
earth. In such cases, the force of gravity is
practically a constant equal to mg, directed
towards the centre of the earth. If we consider
a point at a height h1 from the surface of the
earth and another point vertically above it at a
height h,2 from the surface, the work done in
lifting the particle of mass m from the first to
the second position is denoted by W12

W12 = Force X displacement

= mg (h, — h) (8.20)
