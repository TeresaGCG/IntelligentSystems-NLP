MOTION IN A STRAIGHT LINE

 

statement requires use of calculus. We can,
however, see that it is true for the simple case of
an object moving with constant velocity u. Its
velocity-time graph is as shown in Fig. 3.1 l.

Fig. 3.1 1 Area under v—t curve equals displacement
of the object over a given time interval.

The v-t curve is a straight line parallel to the
time axis and the area under it between t = O
and t= T is the area of the rectangle of height u
and base T. Therefore, area = uXT = uT which
is the displacement in this time interval. How
come in this case an area is equal to a distance?
Think! Note the dimensions of quantities on
the two coordinate axes, and you will arrive at
the answer.

Note that the x-t, v-t, and a-t graphs shown
in several ﬁgures in this chapter have sharp
kinks at some points implying that the
functions are not differentiable at these
points. In any realistic situation, the
functions will be differentiable at all points
and the graphs will be smooth.

What this means physically is that
acceleration and velocity cannot change
values abruptly at an instant. Changes are
always continuous.

3.6 KINEMATIC EQUATIONS FOR
UNIFORMLY ACCELERATED MOTION

For uniformly accelerated motion, we can derive
some simple equations that relate displacement
(x), time taken (t), initial velocity (v0), final
velocity (v) and acceleration (a). Equation (3.6)
already obtained gives a relation between final
and initial velocities v and v0 of an object moving
with uniform acceleration a :

v = v0 + at (3.6)

This relation is graphically represented in Fig. 3. 12.
The area under this curve is :

Area between instants O and t= Area of triangle

uniform acceleration.

As explained in the previous section, the area
under v-t curve represents the displacement.
Therefore, the displacement x of the object is :

Therefore, x = Ea t + Dot

or, X : Dot + Eat (3.8)

Equation (3.7) can also be written as

v+v0

(3.9b)

Equations (3.9a) and (3.9b) mean that the object
has undergone displacement xwith an average
velocity equal to the arithmetic average of the
initial and final velocities.

From Eq. (3.6), t = (v — v0) / a. Substituting this in
Eq. (3.9a), we get

x=5t=(v+v0](v—v0]:v2—v§

v2 = v3 + 2ax (3.10)
