It is worth noting that electrostatic shielding does not work the other
way round; that is, if you put charges inside the cavity, the exterior of
the conductor is not shielded from the fields by the inside charges.

EXERCISES

Two charges 5 X 10‘8 C and —3 X 10’8 C are located 16 cm apart. At
what point(s) on the line joining the two charges is the electric
potential zero? Take the potential at infinity to be zero.

A regular hexagon of side 10 cm has a charge 5 “C at each of its
vertices. Calculate the potential at the centre of the hexagon.

Two charges 2 (LC and —2 ”C are placed at points A and B 6 cm
apart.

(a) Identify an equipotential surface of the system.

(b) What is the direction of the electric field at every point on this
surface?

A spherical conductor of radius 12 cm has a charge of 1.6 X 10’7C
distributed uniformly on its surface. What is the electric field

(a) inside the sphere
(b) just outside the sphere
(c) at a point 18 cm from the centre of the sphere?

A parallel plate capacitor with air between the plates has a
capacitance of 8 pF (lpF = 10‘12 F). What will be the capacitance if
the distance between the plates is reduced by half, and the space
between them is filled with a substance of dielectric constant 6?

Three capacitors each of capacitance 9 pF are connected in series.
(a) What is the total capacitance of the combination?

(b) What is the potential difference across each capacitor if the
combination is connected to a 120 V supply?

Three capacitors of capacitances 2 pF, 3 pF and 4 pF are connected
in parallel.

(a) What is the total capacitance of the combination?

(b) Determine the charge on each capacitor if the combination is
connected to a 100 V supply.

In a parallel plate capacitor with air between the plates, each plate
has an area of 6 X 10’3 m2 and the distance between the plates is 3 mm.
Calculate the capacitance of the capacitor. If this capacitor is
connected to a 100 V supply, what is the charge on each plate of the
capacitor?
