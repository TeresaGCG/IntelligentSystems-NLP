MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF SOLIDS

Answer Total mass of all the performers, tables,
plaques etc. = 280 kg

Mass of the performer = 60 kg

Mass supported by the legs of the performer
at the bottom of the pyramid

= 280 — 60 = 220 kg

Weight of this supported mass

= 220 kg wt. = 220 x 9.8 N = 2156 N.

Weight supported by each thighbone of the
performer = 1/2 (2156) N = 1078 N.

From Table 9.1, the Young’s modulus for bone
is given by

Y = 9.4 x 109 N m‘z.

Length of each thighbone L = 0.5 m

the radius of thighbone = 2.0 cm

Thus the cross-sectional area of the thighbone
A = 7: x (2 x 102)2 m2 = 1.26 x 10'3 m2.
Using Eq. (9.8), the compression in each
thighbone (AL) can be computed as

AL = [(FxL)/(Y>< A)]
= [(1078 >< 0.5)/(9.4 x 109 x 1.26 x 103)]
= 4.55 x 10'5 m or 4.55 x 10'3 cm.

This is a very small change! The fractional
decrease in the thighbone is AL/ L = 0.000091
or 0.009 1%. 4

9.6.2 Determination of Young's Modulus of
the Material of a Wire

A typical experimental arrangement to determine
the Young’s modulus of a material of wire under
tension is shown in Fig. 9.6. It consists of two
long straight wires of same length and equal
radius suspended side by side from a fixed rigid
support. The wire A (called the reference wire)
carries a millimetre main scale M and a pan to
place a weight. The wire B (called the
experimental wire) of uniform area of cross-
section also carries a pan in which known
weights can be placed. A vernier scale V is
attached to a pointer at the bottom of the
experimental wire B, and the main scale M is
fixed to the reference wire A. The weights placed
in the pan exert a downward force and stretch
the experimental wire under a tensile stress. The
elongation of the wire (increase in length) is
measured by the vernier arrangement. The
reference wire is used to compensate for any
change in length that may occur due to change
in room temperature, since any change in length
of the reference wire due to temperature change

will be accompanied by an equal change in
experimental wire. (We shall study these
temperature effects in detail in Chapter 1 1.)

Fig. 9.6 An arrangement for the determination of
Young’s modulus of the material of a wire.

Both the reference and experimental wires are
given an initial small load to keep the wires
straight and the vernier reading is noted. Now
the experimental wire is gradually loaded with
more weights to bring it under a tensile stress
and the vernier reading is noted again. The
difference between two vernier readings gives
the elongation produced in the wire. Let r and L
be the initial radius and length of the
experimental wire, respectively. Then the area
of cross-section of the wire would be n12. Let M
be the mass that produced an elongation AL in
the wire. Thus the applied force is equal to Mg,
where g is the acceleration due to gravity. From
Eq. (9.8), the Young’s modulus of the material
of the experimental wire is given by
