Hendrik Antoon Lorentz
(1853 - 1928) Dutch
theoretical physicist,
professor at Leiden. He
investigated the relationship
between electricity, magnetism,
and mechanics. In order to
explain the observed effect of
magnetic ﬁelds on emitters of
light (Zeeman effect), he
postulated the existence of
electric charges in the atom,
for which he was awarded the
Nobel Prize in 1902.. He derived
a set of transformation
equations (known after him,
as Lorentz transformation
equations) by some tangled
mathematical arguments, but
he was not aware that these
equations hinge on a new
concept of space and time.

F =q[E(r)+ V><B(r)]EF

 

 

E = Q / (41:80):2 (4.1)

where i' is unit vector along 1', and the ﬁeld E is a vector
ﬁeld. A charge q interacts with this ﬁeld and experiences
a force F given by

F = q E =qu‘ /(4TC80)I‘2 (4.2)
As pointed out in the Chapter 1, the field E is not
just an artefact but has a physical role. It can convey
energy and momentum and is not established
instantaneously but takes ﬁnite time to propagate. The
concept of a field was specially stressed by Faraday and
was incorporated by Maxwell in his unification of
electricity and magnetism. In addition to depending on
each point in space, it can also vary with time, i.e., be a
function of time. In our discussions in this chapter, we
will assume that the ﬁelds do not change with time.
The ﬁeld at a particular point can be due to one or
more charges. If there are more charges the fields add
vectorially. You have already learnt in Chapter 1 that
this is called the principle of superposition. Once the ﬁeld
is known, the force on a test charge is given by Eq. (4.2).
Just as static charges produce an electric ﬁeld, the
currents or moving charges produce (in addition) a
magnetic field, denoted by B (r), again a vector ﬁeld. It
has several basic properties identical to the electric ﬁeld.
It is deﬁned at each point in space (and can in addition
depend on time). Experimentally, it is found to obey the
principle of superposition: the magnetieﬁeld of several
sources is the vector addition of magnetic ﬁeld of each
individual source.

4.2.2 Magnetic Field, Lorentz Force

Let us suppose that there is a point charge q (moving
with a velocity v and, located at r at a given time t) in
presence of both the electric ﬁeld E (r) and the magnetic
ﬁeld B (r). The force on an electric charge q due to both
of them can be written as

+F (4.3)

electric magnetic

This force was given first by H.A. Lorentz based on the extensive
experiments of Ampere and others. It is called the Lorentz force. You
have already studied in detail the force due to the electric field. If we
look at the interaction with the magnetic ﬁeld, we ﬁnd the following

features.

(i) It depends on q, v and B (charge of the particle, the velocity and the
magnetic field). Force on a negative charge is opposite to that on a
positive charge.

(ii) The magnetic force q [ v X B ] includes a vector product of velocity
and magnetic ﬁeld. The vector product makes the force due to magnetic
