the radius AS = BS so that AB = b = D 6 where

Fig. 2.2 Parallax method.

Having determined D, we can employ a similar
method to determine the size or angular diameter
of the planet. If dis the diameter of the planet
and a the angular size of the planet (the angle
subtended by d at the earth), we have

a = d/ D (2.2)

The angle 06 can be measured from the same
location on the earth. It is the angle between
the two directions when two diametrically
opposite points of the planet are viewed through
the telescope. Since D is known, the diameter d
of the planet can be determined using Eq. (2.2).

Example 2.1 Calculate the angle of
(a) 10 (degree) (b) 1’ (minute of are or arcmin)

and (c) l”(second of are or are second) in
radians. Use 360°=27t rad, 1°=60’ and
1’ = 60 ”

Answer (a) We have 3600: 21c rad
10 = (n /180) rad = 1.745X10‘2 rad

(b) 10 = 60’ = 1.745><10‘2 rad

1’ = 2.908X10‘1 rad : 2.91><10‘4 rad
(c) 1’ = 60” = 2.908X10‘4 rad

1” = 4.847X10‘4 rad : 4.85><10‘6 rad 4
Example 2.2 A man wishes to estimate
the distance of a nearby tower from him.
He stands at a point A in front of the tower
C and spots a very distant object O in line
with AC. He then walks perpendicular to
AC up to B. a distance of 100 m. and looks
at O and C again. Since 0 is very distant.
the direction 80 is practically the same as

 

 

AO; but he ﬁnds the line of sight of C shifted
from the original line of sight by an angle 0
= 400 (6 is known as parallax) estimate
the distance of the tower C from his original
position A.

Answer We have, parallax angle 6 = 400
From Fig. 2.3, AB = AC tan 9
AC = AB/tane = 100 m/tan 400
= 100m/0.8391 = 119m 4

b Example 2.3 The moon is observed from
two diametrically opposite points A and B
on Earth. The angle 6 subtended at the

moon by the two directions of observation
is 1" 54’. Given the diameter of the Earth to

be about 1.276 x 107 m. compute the
distance of the moon from the Earth.

Answer We have 0 = 1° 54' = 1 14'

 

= (1 14 x 60)” x (4.85 x 10‘6) rad

= 3.32 x 10‘2 rad,
since 1" = 4.85 x 10—6 rad.

Also b = AB = 1.276x107m

Hence from Eq. (2.1), we have the earth-moon

distance,
D = b / 0

= 1.276x107
3.32x10‘2

=3.84><108m 4

Example 2.4 The Sun's angular diameter
is measured to be 1920”. The distance Dof

the Sun from the Earth is 1.496 ><1011 m.
What is the diameter of the Sun ?
