Use Lenz’s law to determine the direction of induced current in the
situations described by Fig. 6.19:

(a) A wire of irregular shape turning into a circular shape;

(b) A circular loop being deformed into a narrow straight wire.

A long solenoid with 15 turns per cm has a small loop of area 2.0 cm2
placed inside the solenoid normal to its axis. If the current carried
by the solenoid changes steadily from 2.0 A to 4.0 A in 0.1 s, what is
the induced emf in the loop while the current is changing?

A rectangular wire loop of sides 8 cm and 2 cm with a small cut is
moving out of a region of uniform magnetic field of magnitude 0.3 T
directed normal to the loop. What is the emf developed across the
cut if the velocity of the loop is 1 cm s'1 in a direction normal to the
(a) longer side, (b) shorter side of the loop? For how long does the
induced voltage last in each case?

A 1.0 m long metallic rod is rotated with an angular frequency of
400 rad s‘l about an axis normal to the rod passing through its one
end. The other end of the rod is in contact with a circular metallic
ring. A constant and uniform magnetic ﬁeld of 0.5 T parallel to the
axis exists everywhere. Calculate the emf developed between the
centre and the ring.

A circular coil of radius 8.0 cm and 20 turns is rotated about its
vertical diameter with an angular speed of 50 rad S‘1 in a uniform
horizontal magnetic field of magnitude 3.0 x 10‘2 T. Obtain the
maximum and average emf induced in the coil. If the coil forms a
closed loop of resistance 10 Q, calculate the maximum value of current
in the coil. Calculate the average power loss due to Joule heating.
Where does this power come from?

A horizontal straight wire 10 m long extending from east to west is
falling with a speed of 5.0 m s‘l, at right angles to the horizontal
component of the earth’s magnetic field, 0.30 x 10‘4 Wb m‘2.

(a) What is the instantaneous value of the emf induced in the wire?
(b) What is the direction of the emf?

(c) Which end of the wire is at the higher electrical potential?

Current in a circuit falls from 5.0 A to 0.0 A in 0.1 s. If an average emf
of 200 V induced, give an estimate of the self-inductance of the circuit.

A pair of adjacent coils has a mutual inductance of 1.5 H. If the
current in one coil changes from O to 20 A in 0.5 s, what is the
change of ﬂux linkage with the other coil?

A jet plane is travelling towards west at a speed of 1800 km/ h. What
is the voltage difference developed between the ends of the wing
