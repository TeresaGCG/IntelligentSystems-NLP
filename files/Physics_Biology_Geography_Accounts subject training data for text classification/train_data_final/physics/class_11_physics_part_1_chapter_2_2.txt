Note that when mole is used, the elementary
entities must be specified. These entities
may be atoms, molecules, ions, electrons,
other particles or specified groups of such
particles.

We employ units for some physical quantities
that can be derived from the seven base units
(Appendix A 6). Some derived units in terms of
the SI base units are given in (Appendix A 6.1).
Some SI derived units are given special names
(AppendixA 6.2) and some derived SI units make
use of these units with special names and the
seven base units (Appendix A 6.3). These are
given in AppendixA 6.2 and A 6.3 for your ready
reference. Other units retained for general use
are given in Table 2.2.

Common SI preﬁxes and symbols for multiples
and sub-multiples are given in Appendix A2.
General guidelines for using symbols for physical
quantities, chemical elements and nuclides are
given in Appendix A7 and those for SI units and
some other units are given in Appendix A8 for
your guidance and ready reference.

2.3 MEASUREMENT OF LENGTH

You are already familiar with some direct methods
for the measurement of length. For example, a
metre scale is used for lengths from 10’3m to 102
m. A vernier callipers is used for lengths to an
accuracy of 10‘4 m. A screw gauge and a
spherometer can be used to measure lengths as
less as to l O’5m. To measure lengths beyond these
ranges, we make use of some special indirect
methods.

2.3.1 Measurement of Large Distances

Large distances such as the distance of a planet
or a star from the earth cannot be measured
directly with a metre scale. An important method
in such cases is the parallax method.

When you hold a pencil in front of you against
some specific point on the background (a wall)
and look at the pencil first through your left eye
A (closing the right eye) and then look at the
pencil through your right eye B (closing the left
eye), you would notice that the position of the
pencil seems to change with respect to the point
on the wall. This is called parallax. The
distance between the two points of observation
is called the basis. In this example, the basis is
the distance between the eyes.

To measure the distance D of a far away
planet S by the parallax method, we observe it
from two different positions (observatories) A and
B on the Earth, separated by distance AB = b
at the same time as shown in Fig. 2.2. We
measure the angle between the two directions
along which the planet is viewed at these two
points. The AASB in Fig. 2.2 represented by
symbol 0 is called the parallax angle or
parallactic angle.

As the planet is very far away, 5 << 1, and

therefore, 0 is very small. Then we

approximately take AB as an arc of length b of a
circle with centre at S and the distance D as
