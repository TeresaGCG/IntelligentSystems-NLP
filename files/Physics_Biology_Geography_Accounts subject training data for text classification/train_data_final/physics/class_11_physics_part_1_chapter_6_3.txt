WORK. ENERGY AND POWER

117

The work done by the force is deﬁned to be
the product of component of the force in the
direction of the displacement and the
magnitude of this displacement. Thus

W= (Fcos 0)d= Rd (6.4)

We see that if there is no displacement, there
is no work done even if the force is large. Thus,
when you push hard against a rigid brick wall,
the force you exert on the wall does no work. Yet
your muscles are alternatively contracting and
relaxing and internal energy is being used up
and you do get tired. Thus, the meaning of work
in physics is different from its usage in everyday
language.

No work is done if :

(i) the displacement is zero as seen in the
example above. A weightlifter holding a 150
kg mass steadily on his shoulder for 30 s
does no work on the load during this time.

(ii) the force is zero. A block moving on a smooth
horizontal table is not acted upon by a
horizontal force (since there is no friction), but
may undergo a large displacement.

(iii) the force and displacement are mutually
perpendicular. This is so since, for 6 = 7c / 2 rad
(= 90"), cos (TC/2) = 0. For the block moving on
a smooth horizontal table, the gravitational
force mg does no work since it acts at right
angles to the displacement. If we assume that
the moon’s orbits around the earth is
perfectly circular then the earth’s
gravitational force does no work. The moon’s
instantaneous displacement is tangential
while the earth’s force is radially inwards and
0 = 7t / 2.

Work can be both positive and negative. If 0 is
between 00 and 90°, cos 0 in Eq. (6.4) is positive.
If 0 is between 900 and 1800, cos 0 is negative.
In many examples the frictional force opposes
displacement and 0 = 180”. Then the work done
by friction is negative (cos 1800 = —1).

From Eq. (6.4) it is clear that work and energy
have the same dimensions, [ML2T2]. The SI unit
of these is joule (J), named after the famous British
physicist James Prescott Joule (1 8 1 1- 1 869). Since
work and energy are so widely used as physical
concepts, alternative units abound and some of
these are listed in Table 6. 1.

electron volt (eV) 1 _6X 10—19 J

calorie (cal) 4.186 J

b Example 6.3 A cyclist comes to a skidding
stop in 10 m. During this process. the force
on the cycle due to the road is 200 N and
is directly opposed to the motion. (a) How
much work does the road do on the cycle ‘?
(b) How much work does the cycle do on
the road ?

Answer Work done on the cycle by the road is

the work done by the stopping (frictional) force

on the cycle due to the road.

(a) The stopping force and the displacement make
an angle of 180° (7: rad) with each other.
Thus, work done by the road,

Wr= chosO
= 200x 10><cos7c

= — 2000 J

It is this negative work that brings the cycle

to a halt in accordance with WE theorem.
(b) From Newton’s Third Law an equal and

opposite force acts on the road due to the

cycle. Its magnitude is 200 N. However, the

road undergoes no displacement. Thus,

work done by cycle on the road is zero. 4

The lesson of Example 6.3 is that though the
force on a body A exerted by the body B is always
equal and opposite to that on B by A (Newton’s
Third Law); the work done on A by B is not
necessarily equal and opposite to the work done
on B by A.

6.4 KINETIC ENERGY

As noted earlier, if an object of mass m has
velocity v, its kinetic energy K is

1 1 2
K = —mv.v = —mv _
2 2 (6 5)

Kinetic energy is a scalar quantity. The kinetic
energy of an object is a measure of the work an
