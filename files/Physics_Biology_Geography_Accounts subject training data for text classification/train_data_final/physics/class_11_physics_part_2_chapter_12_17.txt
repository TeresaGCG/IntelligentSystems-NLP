l 1. In a refrigerator or a heat pump, the system extracts heat 92 from the cold reservoir and
releases Ql amount of heat to the hot reservoir, with work W done on the system. The
co—efficient of performance of a refrigerator is given by

2%: Q2
W 91—92

12. The second law of thermodynamics disallows some processes consistent with the First
Law of Thermodynamics. It states

Kelvin—Planck statement

No process is possible whose sole result is the absorption of heat from a reservoir and
complete conversion of the heat into work.

Clausius statement

No process is possible whose sole result is the transfer of heat from a colder object to a
hotter object.

Put simply, the Second Law implies that no heat engine can have efficiency 1] equal to
l or no refrigerator can have co-efficient of performance on equal to infinity.

13. A process is reversible if it can be reversed such that both the system and the surroundings
return to their original states, with no other change anywhere else in the universe.
Spontaneous processes of nature are irreversible. The idealised reversible process is a
quasi—static process with no dissipative factors such as friction, viscosity, etc.

. Carnot engine is a reversible engine operating between two temperatures Tl (source) and
T2 (sink). The Carnot cycle consists of two isothermal processes connected by two
adiabatic processes. The efficiency of a Carnot engine is given by

(Carnot engine)

No engine operating between two temperatures can have efficiency greater than that of
the Carnot engine.

. If Q > 0, heat is added to the system
If Q < 0, heat is removed to the system
If W > 0, Work is done by the system
If W < 0, Work is done on the system
