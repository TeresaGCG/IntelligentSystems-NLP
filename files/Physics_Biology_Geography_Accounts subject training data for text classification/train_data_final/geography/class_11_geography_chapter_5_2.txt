(v) Colour — some minerals have
characteristic colour determined
by their molecular structure —
malachite. azurite. chalcopyrite etc..
and some minerals are coloured by
impurities. For example. because
of impurities quartz may be white.
green. red. yellow etc.

Streak — colour of the ground powder
of any mineral. It may be of the
same colour as the mineral or may
differ — malachite is green and gives
green streak. ﬂuorite is purple or
green but gives a white streak.
Transparency — transparent: light
rays pass through so that objects
can be seen plainly: translucent
— light rays pass through but will
get diffused so that objects cannot
be seen; opaque — light will not pass
at all.

Structure — particular arrange—
ment of the individual crystals;
fine. medium or coarse grained;
fibrous — separable. divergent.
radiating.

Hardness — relative resistance
being scratched: ten minerals are
selected to measure the degree of
hardness from 1—10. They are:
1_ talc; 2_ gypsum; 3_ calcite; origin. occurrence. alteration and
4. ﬂuorite; 5. apatite; 6. feldspar; relationship with other rocks.

7. quartz; 8. topaz; 9. corundum;

lO. diamond. Compared to this for

example. a fingernail is 2.5 and

glass or knife blade is 5.5.

Specific gravity — the ratio between

the weight of a given object and

the weight of an equal volume of

water; object weighed in air and

then weighed in water and divide

weight in air by the difference of

the two weights.

Petrology is science of rocks. A petrologist
studies rocks in all their aspects ViZ..
mineral composition. texture. structure.
