markets are rarely found in one place.
Transport, communication and trade establish
links between producing centres and
consuming centres. The system of mass
production and exchange is complex. Each
region produces the items for which it is best

Communication TRANSPORT

Transport is a service or facility for the carriage
of persons and goods from one place to the other
using humans, animals and different kinds of
vehicles. Such movements take place over land,

land transport; while shipping and waterways
and airways are the other two modes. Pipelines
carry materials like petroleum, natural gas, and
ores in liquidified form.

service industry created to satisfy the basic
needs of society. It includes transport arteries,
vehicles to carry people and goods, and the

transportation, along with efficient
communication, promote cooperation and
