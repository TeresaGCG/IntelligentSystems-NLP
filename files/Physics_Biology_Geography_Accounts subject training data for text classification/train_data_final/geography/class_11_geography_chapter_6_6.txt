Between mass wasting and mass
movements. which term do you feel is
most appropriate? Why? Can soliﬂuction
be included under rapid ﬂow movements?
Why it can be and can’t be?

In our country debris avalanches and
landslides occur very frequently in the
Himalayas. There are many reasons for
this. One. the Himalayas are tectonically
active. They are mostly made up of
sedimentary rocks and unconsolidated
and semi—consolidated deposits. The
slopes are very steep. Compared to the
Himalayas. the Nilgiris bordering
Tamilnadu. Karnataka. Kerala and the
Western Ghats along the west coast are
relatively tectonically stable and are
mostly made up of very hard rocks; but.
still. debris avalanches and landslides
occur though not as frequently as in the
Himalayas. in these hills. Why? Many
slopes are steeper with almost vertical
cliffs and escarpments in the Western
Ghats and Nilgin‘s. Mechanical weathering
due to temperature changes and ranges
is pronounced. They receive heavy
amounts of rainfall over short periods.
So. there is almost direct rock fall quite
frequently in these places along with
landslides and debris avalanches.

Can you compare the three climatically
controlled agents?
