The Australian Trans-Continental
Railway

This rail-line runs west-east across the southern
part of the continent from Perth on the west
coast, to Sydney on the east coast. passing
through Kalgoorlie, Broken Hill and Port
Augusta (Fig. 8.7).

Adelaide and Alice Spring and to be joined
further to the Darwin—Birdum line.

The Orient Express

This line runs from Paris to Istanbul passing
through Strasbourg, Munich, Vienna,
Budapest and Belgrade. The journey time from
London to Istanbul by this Express is now
reduced to 96 hours as against 10 days by the
sea-route. The chief exports on this rail-route

are cheese, bacon, oats, wine, fruits, and
machinery.

There is a proposal to build aTrans—Asiatic
Railway linking Istanbul with Bangkok via
Iran, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and
Myanmar.

WATER TRANSPORT

One of the great advantages of water
transportation is that it does not require route
construction. The oceans are linked with each
other and are negotiable with ships of various
sizes. All that is needed is to provide port
facilities at the two ends. It is much cheaper
because the friction of water is far less than that
of land. The energy cost of water transportation
is lower. Water transport is divided into sea
routes and inland waterways.
