GEOGRAPHY AS A DISCIPLINE

(ii) Zoo Geography which studies the
spatial patterns and geographic
characteristics of animals and their
habitats.

(iii) Ecology /Ecosystem deals with the
scientific study of the habitats
characteristic of species.

(iv) Environmental Geography concerns
world over leading to the realisation of
environmental problems such as land
gradation, pollution and concerns for
conservation has resulted in the
introduction of this new branch in

geography.

BRANCHES OF GEOGRAPHY BASED ON REGIONAL
APPROACH (FIGURE1.3)

1. Regional Studies/Area Studies
Comprising Macro, Meso and Micro
Regional Studies

2. Regional Planning
Comprising Country/ Rural and Town/
Urban Planning

3. Regional Development

4. Regional Analysis
There are two aspects which are common
to every discipline, these are:

(i) Philosophy
(a) Geographical Thought
(b) Land and Human Interaction /
Human Ecology
(ii) Methods and Techniques
(a) Cartography including Computer
Cartography
(b) QuantitativeTechniques/Statistical
Techniques

(c) Field Survey Methods

(d) Geo-informatics comprising
techniques such as Remote
Sensing, GIS, GPS, etc.

The above classification gives a
comprehensive format of the branches of
geography. Generally geography curricula is
taught and learnt in this format but this
format is not static. Any discipline is bound
to grow with new ideas, problems, methods
and techniques. For example, what was once
manual cartography has now been
transformed into computer cartography.
Technology has enabled scholars to handle
large quantum of data. The internet provides
extensive information. Thus, the capacity to
attempt analysis has increased tremendously.
GIS has further opened vistas of knowledge.
GPS has become a handy tool to find out exact
locations. Technologies have enhanced the
capacity of attempting synthesis with sound
theoretical understanding.

You will learn some preliminary aspects of
these techniques in your book, Practical work
in Geography — Part I (NCERT, 2006). You will
continue to improve upon your skills and
learn about their application.

PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY AND ITS IMPORTANCE

This chapter appears in the book entitled
Fundamentals of Physical Geography. The
contents of the book clearly reﬂect its scope.
It is therefore, appropriate to know the
importance of this branch of geography.
