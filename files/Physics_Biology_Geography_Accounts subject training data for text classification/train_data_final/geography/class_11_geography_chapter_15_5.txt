The Carbon Cycle

Carbon is one of the basic elements of all living
organisms. It forms the basic constituent of
all the organic compounds. The biosphere
contains over half a million carbon compounds
in them. The carbon cycle is mainly the
conversion of carbon dioxide. This conversion
is initiated by the fixation of carbon dioxide
from the atmosphere through photosynthesis.
Such conversion results in the production of
carbohydrate, glucose that may be converted
to other organic compounds such as sucrose,
starch, cellulose, etc. Here, some of the
carbohydrates are utilised directly by the plant
itself. During this process, more carbon dioxide
is generated and is released through its leaves
or roots during the day. The remaining
carbohydrates not being utilised by the plant
become part of the plant tissue. Plant tissues
are either being eaten by the herbivorous
animals or get decomposed by the micro-
organisms. The herbivores convert some of the
consumed carbohydrates into carbon dioxide
for release into the air through respiration. The
micro-organisms decompose the remaining
carbohydrates after the animal dies. The
carbohydrates that are decomposed by the
micro-organisms then get oxidised into carbon

dioxide and are returned to the atmosphere

(Figure 15.2).

The Oxygen Cycle

Oxygen is the main by-product of
photosynthesis. It is involved in the oxidation
of carbohydrates with the release of energy,
carbon dioxide and water. The cycling of
oxygen is a highly complex process. Oxygen
occurs in a number of chemical forms and
combinations. It combines with nitrogen to
form nitrates and with many other minerals
and elements to form various oxides such as
the iron oxide, aluminium oxide and others.
Much of oxygen is produced from the
decomposition of water molecules by sunlight
