Do you know the coastal off—shore bars
offer the first buffer or defence against
storm or tsunami by absorbing most of
their destructive force. Then come the
barriers. beaches. beach dunes and
mangroves. if any. to absorb the
destructive force of storm and tsunami
waves. So. if we do anything which
disturbs the ‘sediment budget' and the
mangroves along the coast. these coastal
forms will get eroded away leaving human
habitations to bear first strike of storm
and tsunami waves.
