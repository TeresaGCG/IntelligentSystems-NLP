Fig. 14.3 : Major currents in the Paciﬁc, Atlantic and Indian oceans

where the wind ﬂow is mostly cyclonic, the
oceanic circulation follows this pattern. In
regions of pronounced monsoonal ﬂow, the
monsoon winds influence the current
movements. Due to the coriolis force, the warm
currents from low latitudes tend to move to the
right in the northern hemisphere and to their
left in the southern hemisphere.

The oceanic circulation transports heat
from one latitude belt to another in a manner
similar to the heat transported by the general
circulation of the atmosphere. The cold waters
of the Arctic and Antarctic circles move towards
warmer water in tropical and equatorial
regions, while the warm waters of the lower
latitudes move polewards. The major currents
in the different oceans are shown in Figure14.3.

Prepare a list of currents which are
found in Pacific, Atlantic and Indian
Oceans.

How is the movement of currents
inﬂuenced by prevailing winds? Give
some examples from Figure 14.3.

Effects of Ocean Currents

Ocean currents have a number of direct and
indirect inﬂuences on human activities. West
coasts of the continents in tropical and
subtropical latitudes (except close to the
equator) are bordered by cool waters. Their
average temperatures are relatively low with a
narrow diurnal and annual ranges. There is
fog, but generally the areas are arid. West coasts
of the continents in the middle and higher
latitudes are bordered by warm waters which
cause a distinct marine climate. They are
characterised by cool summers and relatively
mild winters with a narrow annual range of
temperatures. Warm currents ﬂow parallel to
the east coasts of the continents in tropical and
subtropical latitudes. This results in warm and
rainy climates. These areas lie in the western
margins of the subtropical anti-cyclones. The
mixing of warm and cold currents help to
replenish the oxygen and favour the growth of
planktons, the primary food for fish population.
The best fishing grounds of the world exist
mainly in these mixing zones.
