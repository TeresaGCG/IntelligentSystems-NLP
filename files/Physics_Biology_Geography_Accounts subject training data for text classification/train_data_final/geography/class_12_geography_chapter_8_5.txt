double-tracked and electrified trans—
continental railway in the world. It has helped
in opening up its Asian region to West European

and Yenisei rivers Chita is an important agro-
centre and Irkutsk, a fur centre. There are

gained economic significance because it
connected the Quebec-Montreal Industrial
Region with the wheat belt of the Prairie Region
and the Coniferous Forest region in the north.
Thus each of these regions became
complementary to the other. A loop line from
Winnipeg to Thunder Bay (Lake Superior)
connects this rail-line with one of the important
waterways of the world. This line is the economic
artery of Canada. Wheat and meat are the
important exports on this route.

The Union and Pacific Railway

This rail-line connects New York on the Atlantic
Coast to San Francisco on the Pacific Coast
passing through Cleveland, Chicago, Omaha,
Evans, Ogden and Sacramento. The most
valuable exports on this route are ores, grain,
paper, chemicals and machinery.
