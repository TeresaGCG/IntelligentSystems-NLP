Horizontal Distribution of Pressure

Small differences in pressure are highly
signiﬁcant in terms of the wind direction and

velocity. Horizontal distribution of pressure is
studied by drawing isobars at constant levels.
Isobars are lines connecting places having
equal pressure. In order to eliminate the effect
of altitude on pressure, it is measured at any
station after being reduced to sea level for

85

purposes of comparison. The sea level pressure
distribution is shown on weather maps.

Figure 10.1 shows the patterns of isobars
corresponding to pressure systems. Low-
pressure system is enclosed by one or more
isobars with the lowest pressure in the centre.
High-pressure system is also enclosed by one
or more isobars with the highest pressure in
the centre.

World Distribution of Sea Level Pressure

The world distribution of sea level pressure in
January and July has been shown in Figures
10.2 and 10.3. Near the equator the sea level
pressure is low and the area is known as
equatorial low. Along 30° N and 30° S are
found the high-pressure areas known as the
subtropical highs. Further pole wards along
60° N and 60° S, the low-pressure belts are
termed as the sub polar lows. Near the poles
the pressure is high and it is known as the polar
high These pressure belts are not permanent
