Why do people prefer to live in certain
regions and not in others?

Not gold but only (Wo)men can make
a people great and strong.

(Wo)men who for truth and
honour’s sake, stand fast and suffer
long (Wo)men who toil while others
sleep — who dare while others flee —
they build a nation’s pillars deep and
lift it to the sky.

Ralph Waldo Emerson
