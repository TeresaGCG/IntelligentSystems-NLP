When rocks undergo weathering. some
materials are removed through chemical
or physical leaching by groundwater and
thereby the concentration of remaining
(valuable) materials increases. Without
such a weathering taking place. the
concentration of the same valuable
material may not be sufficient and
economically viable to exploit. process and

refine. This is what is called enrichment.
