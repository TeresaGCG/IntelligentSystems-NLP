movement of the sun. In the northern
hemisphere in winter they move southwards
and in the summer northwards.

Forces Affecting the Velocity
and Direction of Wind

You already know that the air is set in motion
due to the differences in atmospheric pressure.
The air in motion is called wind. The wind
blows from high pressure to low pressure. The
wind at the surface experiences friction. In
addition, rotation of the earth also affects the
wind movement. The force exerted by the
rotation of the earth is known as the Coriolis
force. Thus, the horizontal winds near the
earth surface respond to the combined effect
of three forces — the pressure gradient force,
the frictional force and the Coriolis force. In
addition, the gravitational force acts
downward.

Pressure Gradient Force

The differences in atmospheric pressure
produces a force. The rate of change of pressure
with respect to distance is the pressure
gradient. The pressure gradient is strong where
the isobars are close to each other and is weak
where the isobars are apart.

Frictional Force

It affects the speed of the wind. It is greatest at
the surface and its inﬂuence generally extends
upto an elevation of l - 3 km. Over the sea
surface the friction is minimal.

Coriolis Force

The rotation of the earth about its axis affects
the direction of the wind. This force is called
the Coriolis force after the French physicist who
described it in 1844. It deﬂects the wind to the
right direction in the northern hemisphere and
