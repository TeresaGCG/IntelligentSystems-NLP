The term greenhouse is derived from the
analogy to a greenhouse used in cold
areas for preserving heat. A greenhouse
is made up of glass. The glass which is
transparent to incoming short wave solar
radiation is opaque to outgoing long wave
radiation. The glass. therefore. allows in
more radiation and prevents the long
wave radiation going outside the glass
house. causing the temperature inside
the glasshouse structure warmer than
outside. When you enter a car or a bus.
during summers. where windows are
closed. you feel more heat than outside.
Likewise during winter the vehicles with
closed doors and windows remain warmer
than the temperature outside. This is
another example of the greenhouse effect.
