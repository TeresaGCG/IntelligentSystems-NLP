There is a shift of materials in mass
movements as well as in erosion from one
place to the other, So. why can't both be
treated as one and the same? Can there
be appreciable erosion without rocks
undergoing weathering?

Is weathering solely responsible for soil
formation? If not. why?

Pedology is soil science. A pedologist is a
soil-scientist.
