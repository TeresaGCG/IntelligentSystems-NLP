sides of 0. The symbol for absolute value is . The absolute value of 3
is written symbolically as 3, and the absolute value of –5 is written
symbolically as −5. Using variables, the absolute value of a number a is
written symbolically as a. The absolute value of a number and its magni-
tude are the same thing, and the two phrases are used interchangeably.
Example 2
Find4 and −2.
Solution: 4 is located 4 units to the right of 0 so 4= 4; −2 is
located 2 units to the left of 0, so −2= 2.
Lesson 2-1 Review
1. Graph the numbers 1, −2, and 4 on a number line. Order the numbers
from smallest to greatest.
2. Find 2, −6, and 0.
Lesson 2-2: Adding Integers
As I mentioned earlier, the sum of a number and its additive inverse,
or opposite, is 0; 3 + (−3) = 0 and (−4) + 4 = 0. You can add two integers
together using a number line. To add two integers together, locate the
first number on the number line. Next, find the absolute value of the
second number. That will tell you how many units to move over. The sign
of the second number tells you whether to move to the left or the right. If
the second number is positive, move to the right; if the second number is
negative, move to the left.
Example 1
Find the sum: 4 + (−3)
Solution: Start at 4 and move 3 units to the left, as shown in Figure
2.3: 4 + (−3) = 1.
