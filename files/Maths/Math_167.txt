x ƒ(x) = 2x + 3  Ordered Pairs
−3 −3 (−3,−3)
−2 −1 (−2,−1)
−1 1 (−1, 1)
0 3 (0, 3)
1 5 (1, 5)
2 7 (2, 7)
3 9 (3, 9)
Once you have determined some of the ordered pairs that represent
the function, I recommend graphing them. A carefully drawn picture or a
graph can give lots of insight into the nature of the function. The graph of
these ordered pairs is shown in Figure 9.4.

Now that we have a picture of this function we can make some
observations. First of all, notice that all of the points appear to lie on the
same line. This function was called a “linear function” and now that makes
sense. I mentioned earlier that linear functions have graphs that look like
lines. Now you can see that for yourself.
