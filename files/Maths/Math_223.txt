Example 1
Amanda’s cell phone plan costs $30 per month plus $0.35 per
minute that she talks more than 250 minutes. If she talked for 320
minutes in September, what will her phone bill be?
Solution: Let m represent the number of minutes that Amanda
talks on her phone, and let B represent the bill. We have the
following equation:
B= 30+ 0.35(m− 250)
We know that m is 320, so we have to solve for B when m = 320:
B = 30+ 0.35(320− 250)
= 30+ 0.35(70)
= 30+ 24.5
= 54.5
Amanda’s phone bill will be $54.50.
Example 2
Nathan just purchased a home entertainment center. His plasma
TV cost 31 times as much as his DVD player cost. If his DVD
player cost $90, how much did his plasma TV cost?
Solution: Let d represent the cost of the DVD player, and let P
represent the cost of the plasma TV. Then we have the following
equation relating the two variables:
P= 31d
We need to evaluate P when d = 90:
P= 31⋅ 90 = 2,790
Nathan paid $2,790 for his plasma TV.
Example 3
An electric company charges a customer a $10 service charge
plus $0.04 for each kWh of electricity used. Find the amount Robert
will have to pay if he uses 1500 kWh in a month.
