Linear Functions and Graphs
Algebraic expressions can be thought of as a collection of instruc-
tions. The steps involved in evaluating the expression 2x + 4 are:
1. Take the value of x and double it.
2. Take the number obtained in the previous step and add
4 to it.
When we talk about an algebraic expression it is convenient to have a
name to associate with it. We can call an algebraic expression anything
that we want. Most of the time we call algebraic expressions either ƒ(x)
or y. The function name ƒ(x) is pronounced “ƒ of x.” The function ƒ(x)
defined by ƒ(x) = 2x+ 4 would be read as “ƒ of x equals two x plus four.”
The name is not as important as the set of instructions that goes along
with it.
Once you name an algebraic expression, a function is born. A func-
tion usually involves two variables. One variable is contained in the alge-
braic expression and is called the independent variable. The other variable
is the name of the function and is called the dependent variable. We
think of the dependent variable depending on the values of the indepen-
dent variable.
Before I talk about linear functions, I will need to discuss relations
and functions in general, and point out their differences.

A relation is a mathematical way of establishing a relationship be-
tween two quantities. One of the quantities in the relationship is called
