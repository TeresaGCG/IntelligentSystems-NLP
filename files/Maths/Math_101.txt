Decimals
101
Comparing two fractions is a little bit more tricky. If the denomina-
tors of the two fractions are equal, then the problem involves comparing
the numerators.
Example 4
Compare:  and 
Solution: Because both denominators are the same, we need only
compare the numerators.
Because 3 < 8, 
When the denominators are different, you can take two approaches.
The first approach involves finding the lowest common denominator and
then comparing numerators. The second approach involves converting
each fraction to a decimal number and comparing the results.
Example 5
Compare:  and 
Solution: In this case, the lowest common denominator is 12.
Transform both fractions so that their denominators are 12 and
then compare their numerators:
Because 8 < 9, 
So:
