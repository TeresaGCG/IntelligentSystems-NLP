andr represents the radius of the circle,
the diameter and the radius satisfy this
Radius
equation:
d = 2r
In other words, the diameter of a Diameter
circle is twice the size of the radius.

The length of the boundary of a
circle is called the circumference of the
circle. The circumference of a circle is
similar to the perimeter of a polygon,
in that it measures the length of the
boundary.

It was observed thousands of years
ago that the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter is al-
ways the same numerical value. This really is magical. It doesn’t matter
whether the circle is really big, or really small—the ratio of the circum-
ference of any circle to its diameter is always the same number. This
ratio is called pi and is represented by the Greek letter π. Given any
circle:
π= circumference
diameter
Pi is an irrational number, and its value has been calculated to more
than one trillion decimal places. Pi appears throughout mathematics.
Ancient Greek mathematicians were able to calculate π very accurately
(though not to more than a trillion decimal places). This is impressive,
given the technological resources available at the time. The value of π is
roughly 3.141592653589.
Some people approximate π by the ratio  2  2 .

This rational approximation, however, is just that: an approximation. Pi
is not a rational number. Because π is a constant, we can use it to relate
the circumference of a circle to its diameter, and hence its radius. If we
let C represent the circumference of a circle, d represent the diameter,
and r represent the radius, we have:
C = πd = 2πr
