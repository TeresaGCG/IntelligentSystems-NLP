Subtract 5 from both sides
Simplify
Next, we want the coefficient in front of the variable to be 1. You
can transform this equation by multiplying both sides of this
equation by 3 and then simplifying:
Multiply both sides by 3
Simplify x= −24
Finally, check your answer.
Is  equal to −3? Yes.
Example 2
Solve the equation: 
Solution: In this case, you will see terms with variables appearing
on both sides of the equation. You want to collect all of the terms
with variables on one side of the equation and then solve the
equation using the same techniques described earlier. In order to
get all of the variables on one side of the equation, we need to
subtract  from both sides and simplify:
Subtract  from both sides
