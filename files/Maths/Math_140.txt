There is a common misconception about the relationship between
mark-up and discount that I will now address. Suppose that a clothing
store has a 55% mark-up on business suits and that the store pays $100
for each business suit. The store will mark-up the business suit by $55,
and charge $155. Now, suppose that the business suits are not selling very
well, and the store decides to discount the suits by 55%. In other words,
the business suits were initially marked up 55% and then they were dis-
counted 55%. Let’s compare the sale price to the price that the store
paid for each business suit.
The mark-up percent was 55%, so the price to the consumer was
$155. The discount percent is also 55%, so the discount will be 0.55 × 155,
which is $85.25. That means that the sale price will be 155 − 85.25, or
$69.75. That’s quite a bit lower than the store price! This result may go
against your intuition. It would seem that if you mark-up and then dis-
count by the same percent then you would be back where you started,
but this is not the case. The reason for this is that your mark-up percent
is applied to the lower price, and the discount percent is applied to the
higher price. If the mark-up percent and the discount percent are the
same value, then the mark-up amount will be less than the discount amount.
You will end up at a lower price than where you started.
