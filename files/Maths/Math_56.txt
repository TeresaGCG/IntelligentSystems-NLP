However, there is a better way. Instead of blindly multiplying numera-
tors together and denominators together, factor both numerators and
both denominators, and cancel out any common factors. You will find
that the job will be much easier.
Example 7
Perform the following multiplication: 
Solution: Rather than finding the products 5 × 63 and 18 × 130,
it’s better to factor the numerators and denominators completely
and cancel what you can:
If you had decided to ignore my earlier advice and multiplied the
fractions together without trying to cancel first, you would have gotten
the fraction  . Create a factor tree for those numbers and then get
back to me!
Example 8
Perform the following multiplication: 
Solution:
This last example occurs so frequently that it is worth writing out
more formally.
( )
b
If a and b are non-zero numbers, then a × = b.
a
Thea’s cancel out and you are left with just the numerator of the second
factor.
