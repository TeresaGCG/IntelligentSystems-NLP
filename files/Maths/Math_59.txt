Lesson 3-4: Adding Fractions
If the two fractions that you are adding have the same denominator,
then adding the fractions is fairly straightforward: All you do is add the
numerators and keep the denominator the same. Of course, once you
have added the fractions you may need to reduce the result.
For example, we can find the sum  :
It’s when the denominators are different that things get a bit tricky.
The only time you are allowed to add two fractions is when their denomi-
nators are the same. If the two fractions have different denominators you
have to turn them into fractions that have the same denominator. The
only tool you have at your disposal is to multiply by 1, but remember that
1 has many disguises.
Suppose you want to add the fractions   and  . Clearly these two
fractions have different denominators, so you can’t just start adding nu-
merators together. You must first change these fractions so that they
have the same denominator, and the best denominator to use is the least
common multiple. The least common multiple of 3 and 2 is 6. We will
then convert each fraction into a form that has 6 as the denominator
without changing the value of the fraction. This can be thought of as the
reverse of canceling. Instead of reducing a fraction you are introducing
common factors to both the numerator and the denominator so that the
denominators in the two fractions being added will be the same.
