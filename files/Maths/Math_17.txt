3. 136 + 158
4. 716 + 237
Lesson 1-3: Subtraction
The symbol for subtraction is –. The number to be subtracted from is
called the minuend, and the number to be subtracted is called the subtra-
hend. The result of the subtraction is called the difference. The symbol
for what the difference is equal to is the equal sign, =.
Subtraction is the reverse of addition. If 5 + 3 = 8 then 8 − 3 = 5 and
8 − 5 = 3. You can always check your answers by adding the difference
and the subtrahend together; their sum should be the minuend.
Even though subtraction is the reverse of addition, there are some
differences between the two operations. With subtraction, the order does
matter; subtraction is not commutative. We also cannot group things ar-
bitrarily; subtraction is not associative. We will talk more about the or-
der in which we calculate in Lesson 1-8.
Sometimes subtraction is written horizontally: 8 − 5 = 3. Other times
subtraction is written vertically:
The vertical representation is particularly useful when you are sub-
tracting two numbers with two or more digits. When you subtract one
two-digit number from another you can write the two numbers in a col-
umn format with the ones, tens, hundreds, etc. aligned. Subtract each
column of digits; if the top digit is smaller than the bottom digit you need
to borrow from the column to the left.
