Exponents

Example 1
Will the following products be positive or negative?
a.(−6)4 c. −2 × (−4)6 e. 5 × (−3)6
b.−64 d.−2 × 53 f. −5 × (−2)7
Solution:
a. The overall product will be positive. There are 4 negative
signs (because the negative is part of the base). (−6)4 means
(−6)(−6)(−6)(−6).
b. The overall product will be negative. There is only one
negative sign (because the negative is not part of the base).
−64 means the opposite of 64.
c. The overall product will be negative. There are 7 negative
signs in the product (one from the −2 and 6 from (−4)6).
d. The overall product will be negative. There is only one
negative sign in the product.
e. The overall product will be positive. There are 6 negative
signs involved in the product (from (−3)6).
f. The overall product will be positive. There are 8 negative
signs involved in the product (one from the −5 and 7
from (−2)7).
The introduction of exponents requires an expansion to the order of
operations. Exponential expressions involve repetitive multiplication, and
multiplication and division are done right after any instructions in paren-
theses. As a result, exponentiation will come before multiplication or
division in the order of operations. Parentheses still come first, though.
Our expanded order of operations is now as follows:
1. Parentheses
2. Exponentiation
3. Multiplication and division read left to right
4. Addition and subtraction read left to right
