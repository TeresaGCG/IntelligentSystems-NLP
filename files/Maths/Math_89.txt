not necessarily the same power of 10), the common denominator will
also be a power of 10. To determine the power of 10 of the common
denominator, simply pick the larger of the two.
Example 2
Find the sum: 0.325 + 0.4062
Solution: Convert each decimal number to a fraction. Notice that
0.325 has three digits to the right of the decimal point (meaning
that the denominator of its corresponding fraction would be 103 )
and 0.4062 has four digits to the right of the decimal point (meaning
that the denominator of its corresponding fraction will be 104).
Because 104 > 103,104 will be our common denominator:
We can now make the two denominators the same and add the
fractions:
Finally, we will convert our result to a decimal number:
Another way to add two decimal fractions is to line up the decimal
points and added the numbers directly. Remember that I can always add
0s after the last digit to the right of the decimal point as placeholders.
That means that the equation 0.325 + 0.4062 = 0.7312
is equivalent to the equation 0.3250 + 0.4062 = 0.7312
and lining up the digits gives us:
