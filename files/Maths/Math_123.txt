Ratios, Proportions, and Percents
123
ratios are calculated, as long as they are all calculated the same way. The
important thing is to think about what your ratios mean and base your
decision accordingly.
Size Unit Rate
10 ounces (small)
18 ounces (medium)
32 ounces (large)
As a word of warning, you cannot always assume that a larger size has
a lower unit rate. There are many times I have calculated the unit rates of
different sizes of products such as detergent, dog food, and charcoal, and
found that the larger size had a more expensive corresponding unit rate.
It may be that the items were incorrectly priced, or that the discrepancy
resulted from a temporary price reduction in the smaller-sized item. I
have learned to always compare unit rates when deciding between differ-
ent sizes.
Lesson 7-1 Review
Answer the following:
1. When pricing dog food I discovered that a 5-pound bag of food
costs $8.49, a 20-pound bag costs $21.49, and a 40-pound bag costs
$29.99. Calculate the unit rates for each of these bags.
2. When pricing soda, I discovered that a 12-pack costs $2.99 and a
24-pack costs $5.00. Calculate the unit rates for each of these
options.
3. Kendelyn bought a new car. When she drove 200 miles in the city,
the car consumed 8 gallons of gasoline. When she drove 300 miles
