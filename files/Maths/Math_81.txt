Simplify:
Solution: Factor 120 into products of perfect squares:
120= 4 ⋅ 30 so,
The easiest way to approach these problems is to look at the list of
perfect squares and check to see if any of them divides the radicand
evenly. If so, factor the radicand into a product of a perfect square and
another factor:
Radicand ===== Perfect Square ××××× Other Factor
Now do the same thing with the other factor: See if any other perfect
squares divide that other factor. If they do, keep factoring. If not, pull
out all of the perfect squares that you found.
The only way for the square root of a number to be a whole number
is if it is a perfect square, and the only way that the square root of a
number can be a rational number is if it is the ratio of two perfect squares.
The square root of any other kind of number is an irrational number.
Recall that irrational numbers are numbers that cannot be written as the
ratio of two integers.
