to the exact same powers. The only possible variation in the monomials is
in their coefficients. For example, you can add the monomials 2x2y3 and
5x2y3 together to get 7x2y3, but if you try to add the monomials 2x2y3 and
5x2y2 together you will get 2x2y3+5x2y2. There is no further simplification
that you can do with the expression 2x2y3+5x2y2 because the powers of y
are different in the two monomials: The power of y in the first mono-
mial is 3 and the power of y in the second monomial is 2. You cannot
break apart a monomial. The variables in a monomial have to stick
together.
Example 1
Combine the following monomials, if possible:
a. 5xy+ 4xy
b. 3x2−x2
c. 12xyz+ 16xyz
d. 12xy2− 5xy
Solution:
a. 5xy+ 4xy=9xy
b. 3x2−x2= 2x2
c. 12xyz+ 16xyz= 28xyz
d. 12xy2 − 5xy = 12xy2 − 5xy; no simplification is possible, the
powers of y are different in the two monomials
