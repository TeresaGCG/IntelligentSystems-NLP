point (c, b) is the key to the distance formula, because it is the point that
helps form the right triangle. Now we need to find the lengths of the legs
of our right triangle.
Because our endpoints involve variables, there is no way that we will
be able to determine which x-coordinate is bigger. We will need to use
absolute value symbols to make sure that our lengths are positive.
(cid:96) The horizontal leg is the line segment with endpoints (a, b)
and (c, b); the length of the horizontal leg is c − a.
(cid:96) The vertical leg is the line segment with endpoints (c, b) and
(c, d); the length of the vertical leg is d − b.
Now we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of the
hypotenuse, which is the distance between the points (a, b) and (c, d):
I dropped the absolute value symbols in the second step. The reason
for this is that when we square a number, whether it is positive or nega-
tive, the result will always be a positive number, so the absolute value
symbols are no longer necessary. Keeping them around only makes the
formula more complicated; because they don’t add anything of value, it is
not worth including them in the equation.
Looking at the distance formula, we see that the distance between
two points involves squaring the difference between the x-coordinates,
squaring the difference between the y-coordinates, adding the two re-
sults, and then taking the square root of that sum. There is no need to
find the mysterious point, and there is no need to draw a picture. The
distance formula gives the correct result every time.
Let me mention again the importance of understanding where the
distance formula comes from: the Pythagorean Theorem. If you do get
stuck and forget the distance formula, graph the two points, find the
mysterious third point to create a right triangle, and use the Pythagorean
Theorem.
