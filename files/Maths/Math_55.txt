Operations With Fractions

Example 5
Reduce the fraction: 
Solution: The first step in reducing a fraction is to completely
factor the numerator and the denominator. 6 = 2 × 3 and 9 = 3 × 3.
Both 6 and 9 are evenly divisible by 3, so we can write:
As you become familiar with the process, you will find yourself
leaving out some of the intermediate steps and writing something
similar to this:
This process is often referred to as “canceling.” In the example we
just did, we “cancelled the 3s.” What we are really doing is making use of
those useful properties of multiplication mentioned earlier. Remember
that the key to reducing fractions is to factor the numerator and the
denominator completely. This is done by creating factor trees for the
numerator and the denominator. Canceling is done only when multiplica-
tion and division are the only operations involved in the fraction.
Example 6
Reduce the fraction: 
Solution: Factor the numerator and denominator completely:
12= 2 × 2 × 3 and 30 = 2 × 3 × 5. Both 12 and 30 are evenly
divisible by both 2 and 3, so:
When you multiply two fractions together, the numbers can get aw-
fully big. After you multiply the two fractions together you will have to
check to make sure that the numerator and denominator are relatively
prime, which means that you may find yourself factoring big numbers.
