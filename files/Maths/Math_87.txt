Decimals
87
If the denominator of the fraction being converted is not a power of
10, then converting from a fraction to a decimal number involves expand-
ing on our method of division. In Chapter 1 we discussed long division
and the concept of a remainder. The remainder was the number “left
over” when the divisor did not divide evenly into the dividend. With
decimal numbers, division doesn’t stop with a remainder, it keeps going,
and going, and going, until a pattern is discovered. Remember that all
rational numbers have a decimal representation that either terminates
or establishes a pattern. Converting a fraction to a decimal number
involves long division until you reach the point of finding the remain-
der. At this point, instead of stopping, you insert a decimal point and a 0
to the right of the decimal point and continue with the long division pro-
cess. The decimal point serves to divide the integral part and the frac-
tional part.
Example 3
Convert  to a decimal number.
Solution:
If we were writing   as a mixed number, we would have stopped
when the result of the subtraction was 17, and our answer would have
been . Because we were converting   to a decimal number, we had
to keep going until the division process terminated with a remainder of 0,
or until a pattern was established. In this case the division process termi-
nated with a remainder of 0.
