Example 2
A line segment has an endpoint at (4, 2) and a midpoint at (1, −2).
Find the location of the other endpoint.
Solution: Now we are given one endpoint and the midpoint. We
need to find the coordinates of the other endpoint. Let (x, y)
represent the coordinates of the endpoint we are trying to find.
From the formula for the midpoint we see that:
We can solve the first equation for x and the second equation
for y:
So the other endpoint is located at (−2, −6)
Lesson 10-2 Review
Solve the following problems:
1. Find the midpoint of the segment with endpoints located at (−3, 5)
and(2, 6).
2. If a line segment has an endpoint located at (−2, 4) and a midpoint
located at (−4, 6), find the location of the other endpoint.
Lesson 10-3: Perimeter
Theperimeter of a geometric shape is the sum of all of the lengths of
the sides of the shape. For example, a triangle has three sides, and the
perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of the three sides.
