Lesson 11-3: Adding and Subtracting Polynomials
A polynomial is the sum of two or more monomials. The sign of the
constant k involved in each of the monomials determines whether the
monomial is to be added to, or subtracted from, the other monomials in
the chain. The monomials that make up a polynomial are usually written
in descending order based on the degree of the monomial. In other words,
you start writing a polynomial by writing the monomial with the highest
degree first, then the second highest degree, and so on. This is consid-
ered the standard form of a polynomial. When a polynomial is written
in standard form, the coefficient of the first term is called the leading
coefficient.
