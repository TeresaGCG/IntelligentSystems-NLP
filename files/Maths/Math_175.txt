Example 3
Graph the line given by the equation y = 3x.
Solution: First, find the y-intercept by setting x = 0: y = 3 ⋅ 0 = 0.
Notice that this line passes through the origin (0, 0), which means
that the x-intercept and the y-intercept are the same point. So
we will need to pick a different value of x in order to come up
with another point on the line. It doesn’t matter what value we
pick for x; to keep it simple, pick x= 1. Use that value to solve for
y: y = 3 ⋅ 1 = 3. Then plot the two points (0, 0) and (1, 3) and
connect them, as shown in Figure 9.7.
