Example 1
Five more than an integer is the same as twice the integer. Find
the integer.
Solution: Let x represent the integer. From the problem description
we can write down an equation and solve it:
So, the integer is 5.
Example 2
Two more than twice an integer is 8. Find the integer.
Solution: Let x represent the integer. From the problem description
we can write down an equation and solve it:
The integer is 3.
Example 3
Suppose you take an integer, subtract 8, multiply by 7, add 10,
and divide by 5. If the result is 9, what was the original integer?
Solution: Let x represent the original integer. From the problem
description we can write down an equation and solve it. When
you write down the equation you will need to keep in mind the
order of operations use parentheses where necessary:
Multiply both sides of the equation by 5
