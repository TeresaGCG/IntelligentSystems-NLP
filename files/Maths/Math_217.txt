Applications
Algebra has been around for a long time precisely because it is so
useful. Algebra provides us with efficient techniques that enable us to
solve problems systematically. Up until now, I have given you the equa-
tions to solve. At this point in the book, the problems will be put into the
context of a story and you will have to come up with an equation first, and
then solve it.
Lesson 12-1: How to Approach Word Problems
A word problem involves a description of a situation and a question
to answer. There are no variables in the word problem; it is your job to
come up with variables and write an equation based on the information
given in the original question. The nice thing about word problems is that
they are a closer representation of how algebra will serve you in everyday
life. I seriously doubt that you will be walking down the street and some-
one will ask you, “What is x ÷ 5 if x = 20?” However, you may encounter
someone who will ask you if you if you can change a twenty-dollar bill
into five-dollar bills, and you would need to figure out how many five-
dollar bills to give him or her for the twenty.
I recommend using a systematic method for approaching and solving
word problems. Here is one problem-solving approach that will help you
solve word problems.
(cid:96) Read the problem description and pick out the important
information. Determine what you are given and what you are
asked to find. Choose variables to represent what you are
