Example 1
Find the product: 3.2 × 4.6
Solution: First, ignore the decimal points and find the product:
The whole number product is 1,472. Now we need to place the
decimal point. Each factor has one digit to the right of the decimal
point, so there are two digits total to the right of the decimal
point. We need our product to have two digits to the right of the
decimal point, giving an answer of 14.72.
Example 2
Find the product: 3.24 × 2.8
Solution: First, ignore the decimal points and find the product:
The whole number product is 9,072. Now we need to place the
decimal point. The first factor has two digits to the right of the
decimal point and the second factor has one digit to the right of
the decimal point; there are a total of three digits total to the
right of the decimal point. The resulting product will have three
digits to the right of the decimal point, giving an answer of 9.072.
