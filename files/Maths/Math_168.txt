The graph of ƒ(x) = 2x+ 3 is a line that is not horizontal (as the x-axis
is) and is not vertical (as the y-axis is). It is worth measuring the slant, or
slope, of lines that are not vertical or horizontal. The slope of a line is
defined as the ratio of the “rise” of a graph divided by the “run” of the
graph, or the “rise over the run” of the graph. The rise of the graph is a
measurement of the change in the dependent variable (the variable y or
ƒ(x)), and the run of the graph is a measurement of the change in the
independent variable (the variable x):
change in y ∆y
Slope = =
change in x ∆x
You are already comfortable using the symbol ∆ to represent change,
which you remember from Chapter 7. The change in a variable is just the
final value of the variable minus the initial value of the variable. You
usually calculate the slope of a line between two points. If you have two
points, say (a, b) and (c, d), then the change in the dependent variable
would be found by taking the difference between the y-coordinates of the
two points: ∆y = d − b. The change in the independent variable would be
found by taking the difference between the x-coordinates of the two points:
∆x=c−a. Then the slope of the line would be found by using the previous
equation:
You may be wondering how I knew that the point (c, d) was the final
point and (a, b) was the initial point. In reality, it doesn’t matter. If I had
switched them so that (a, b) was the final point and (c, d) was the initial
point, I would have calculated the slope to be
So it is not important which point is considered to be the final point
and which point is considered to be the initial point. What is important is
that the change in y goes in the numerator of the fraction and the change
in x goes in the denominator of the fraction. The other thing that is
important is that you are consistent in which point you use as the final
