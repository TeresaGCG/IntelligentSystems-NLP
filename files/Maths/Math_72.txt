Notice that every factor of 5 in the denominator cancels with a 5 in
the numerator. The resulting exponent is just what you’d get if you sub-
tracted the exponent in the denominator from the exponent in the nu-
merator. That gives us our quotient rule for exponents: When you divide
two numbers with the same base you subtract the exponent in the de-
nominator from the exponent in the numerator. This can be stated math-
ematically as:
am
= am−n
an

We’ve multiplied and divided exponential expressions. Now it’s time
to explore what happens when the base of an exponential expression is
itself an exponential expression.
