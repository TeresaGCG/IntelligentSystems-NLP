Lesson 5-5: Rounding and Estimating
Sometimes exact numbers give too much information. For example,
there may be 7,853 people living in a particular town, but the town’s
Website may round up to the nearest thousand and say that there are
8,000 residents. People usually prefer nice, round numbers, and the more
0s involved in the number, the happier they are. It doesn’t matter that
our national debt is currently $8,017,113,351,645. It’s enough to say that
our national debt is around $8 trillion. The key to rounding is to recog-
nize that 5 is the cut-off. The numbers less than 5 (meaning 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4)
turn into 0s. This is called rounding down. The numbers greater than or
equal to 5 (meaning 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9) turn into 0s and bump the immediate
digit to the left up by one unit. This is the same thing as turning into a 10
and being carried over. This is called rounding up.
The number 852.654 becomes 1,000 when rounding to the nearest
thousand. It becomes 900 when rounding to the nearest hundred. It be-
comes 850 when rounding to the nearest ten. It becomes 853 when round-
ing to the nearest one. It becomes 852.7 when rounding to the nearest
tenth. It becomes 852.65 when rounding to the nearest hundredth. Round-
ing depends on the place on which you are focusing. When rounding to
the nearest ten, your rounding digit is the digit in the tens place. You
look at the digit immediately to the right and follow the rounding rules
with a cut-off of 5.
When you round a number, you are changing that number. The
rounded number is not equal to the original number, but it is close. A
handy symbol to represent being close, or approximate, but not equal to,
is ≈.
Example 1
Round 65.32 to the nearest one.
Solution: 65.32 ≈ 65
