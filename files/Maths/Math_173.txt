to do it my way, though. You can draw your graphs using your two favorite
points and compare your graphs to mine. It doesn’t matter which two
points you plot and connect, as long as the points actually lie on the line
in question.
Example 1
Graph the line given by the equation: y = 2x + 1
Solution: First, find the y-intercept by
setting x = 0 and finding y: y = 2⋅ 0 + 1 = 1
Then find the x-intercept by setting y = 0
and solving for x:
Then plot the two intercepts (0, 1) and   and connect the
points, as shown in Figure 9.5.
