Lesson 5-1 Review
Convert the following decimal fractions to reduced fractions, and the
improper fractions to decimal numbers:
1. 0.68 3.
2. 0.12 4.
Lesson 5-2: Adding and Subtracting Decimal Numbers
Decimal numbers can be added together in several ways. One way to
add decimal numbers is to convert them first to fractions and then add
the resulting fractions. The resulting fraction can then be converted to a
decimal number using division, if necessary. This method will always work,
but after a few examples you will notice some shortcuts.
Example 1
Find the sum: 0.65 + 0.13
Solution: Convert each decimal fraction to a fraction, and then
add the fractions together. There is no need to reduce the
fractions, because you will have to “un-reduce” them to get a
common denominator so that you can add the fractions together:
There is no need to reduce the resulting fraction, because you can
easily convert it to a decimal fraction because the denominator is
a power of 10:
Adding decimal fractions together is quite straightforward. We just
saw how decimal fractions can be converted to fractions that have a de-
nominator equal to a power of 10. Because both decimal numbers will be
converted to fractions whose denominators are a power of 10 (though
