Well, 0 > −1. Notice that we started with 0 < 1, and when we multiplied
both sides of the inequality 0 < 1 by −1 we end up with the inequality 0 > −1.
This leads us to an important rule about multiplying an inequality by a
negative number: When you multiply an inequality by a negative num-
ber you must flip the inequality symbol. We can write this mathemati-
cally as:
If a < b and c < 0  then a⋅ c>b⋅  c
This flipping rule also holds when you divide both sides of an inequal-
ity by a negative number. Keep in mind that the focus is on the sign of the
number by which you are multiplying both sides of the inequality.
Lesson 8-3: Solving Inequalities in 1 Step
Solving an inequality is very similar to solving an equality. The goal is
still to isolate the variable on one side of the inequality. The transforma-
tion rules for inequalities are similar to those for equality. One of the
main differences in the procedure occurs when you multiply or divide
both sides of an inequality. You must be sure to flip the inequality when
you multiply (or divide) both sides by a negative number.
The other difference between solving equalities and solving inequali-
ties is that with equalities, if you have an equation such as 3 = x  you are
allowed to interchange the sides and write x = 3. The reason you can do
this is because equality has the symmetric property. Inequalities do not
