is the circle at −3. The open ray has an open circle and the closed ray has a
closed (or filled in) circle. Both of these rays point to the left because we
are describing points that are less than (or less than or equal to) −3.

Figure 8.4 shows an open ray representing the set of real numbers
greater than 2 and the closed ray representing the set of real numbers
greater than or equal to 2. Notice that the only difference between these
two rays is the circle at 2. The open ray has an open circle and the closed
ray has a closed (or filled in) circle. Both of these rays point to the right
because we are describing points that are greater than (or greater than or
equal to) 2.

In the last section we solved several inequalities and described the
solution in words. We will take a minute to give a graphical solution to
those same inequalities.
