Lesson 4-3: Negative Integer Powers
We need an interpretation for when the exponent of a number is
negative. Mathematicians have chosen to think of a–1 as the reciprocal of
a non-zero number a. Recall that we wrote the reciprocal of a non-zero
number a as  .
We have two ways to express the reciprocal of a:
1
either     or a–1
a
Using this information we can interpret exponents that are negative
integers. We can use the power rule for exponents to interpret an expres-
sion such as 2–4:
On the other hand, we can also interpret 2–4 as  . Because 24=16,
and the reciprocal of 16 is  , we see that:
