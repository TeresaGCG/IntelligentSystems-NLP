Lesson 4-2: Rules for Exponents
Many mathematical rules have been developed by working out spe-
cific problems and looking for patterns. Now that we can deal with posi-
tive integer exponents, it’s time to make some observations. Let’s look at
what happens when we multiply two exponential expressions with the
same base. For example, let’s find the product of 23 and 25:
23× 25= (2 × 2× 2)× (2× 2× 2× 2× 2)= 2× 2× 2× 2× 2× 2× 2× 2= 28
Notice that the exponents of the two products are 3 and 5, and the
exponent of the result is 8, which is 3+5. This observation is actually our
product rule for exponents: When you multiply two numbers with the
same base, you add the exponents. This can be stated mathematically as
am × an = am+n
Example 1
Find the following products. Leave your answers as exponential
expressions:
a. 65× 67
b. (−3)6× (−3)8
c. 74× 73
Solution:
a. 65× 67=65 + 7= 612
b. (−3)6× (−3)8 = (−3)6+8= (−3)14
c. 74× 73= 74+3= 77
Next let’s explore what happens when you divide two exponential
expressions with the same base.
For example, let’s evaluate  :
