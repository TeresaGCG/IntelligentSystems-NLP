To find the reciprocal of a fraction, the numerator becomes the de-
nominator and the denominator becomes the numerator. In other words,
the reciprocal of the fraction   is the fraction  . The reciprocal of an
integer is the fraction whose numerator is 1 and whose denominator is
equal to the integer. In other words, the reciprocal of a is  .
Fractions can involve positive or negative numbers in the numerator
or the denominator. The following fractions are all equal in value:
If your fraction is negative, it doesn’t matter whether the negative
sign is in front of the fraction, associated with the numerator or associ-
ated with the denominator. Remember that fractions involve division,
and the sign of a quotient will be negative if the divisor and the dividend
have opposite signs. Remember that the parts of a fraction correspond to
the parts of a quotient.
While I’m on the subject of negative signs, recall that the product of
two negative numbers is a positive number, and a negative number di-
vided by a negative number is a positive number. The same rule holds for
fractions: If both the numerator and the denominator are negative, then
the overall fraction will be positive.
Lesson 3-1: Multiplying Fractions
Multiplying fractions is very straightforward. When multiplying two
fractions, multiply the two numerators together to get the numerator of
the product and multiply the two denominators together to get the de-
nominator of the product. We can write this algebraically as:
Example 1
Find the product:
Solution: Multiply the two numerators together and the two
denominators together:
