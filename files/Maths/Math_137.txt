mark-up
Percent mark-up =
store’s price
The percent mark-up can also be found using the ratio:
price − price
Percent mark-up = consumer store
price
store
If we are given the percent mark-up and one of prices, either the
price that the store pays or the price that the store charges the consumer,
we can use this ratio to determine the other price. If we are given both
prices we can first find the mark-up and then find the percent mark-up.
Make sure that you convert the percent mark-up to its decimal equiva-
lent when working out these calculations.
Example 1
A grocery store has a 70% mark-up on its beef. If the store pays
$9 per pound for filet mignon, find the mark-up and the price to
the consumer.
Solution: Convert the percent mark-up to a decimal, and use the
equation for percent mark-up to determine the mark-up:
The mark-up is $6.30 per pound.
The price to the consumer is the store’s cost plus the mark-up.
The price to the consumer is therefore:
$9+ $6.30 , or $15.30 per pound
