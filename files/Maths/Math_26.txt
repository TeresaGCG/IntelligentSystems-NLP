There is a systematic approach for finding factors.
(cid:82) First, check to see whether the composite number is even or odd. An
even number is a number that is evenly divisible by 2. Examples of
even numbers are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12…. Even numbers are easy to
recognize because their last digit is either 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. Numbers
that are not even are called odd numbers. Odd numbers are also easy
to recognize: Their last digit is either 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9. If a composite
number is even, it will be divisible by 2 (the first prime number).
(cid:82) If a composite number is not even, check to see if it is evenly divisible
by 3. One way to do this is to actually do the division. If the remainder
is 0 then 3 is a factor of the number. If the remainder is not 0 then 3
is not a factor. There is a shortcut available to see if 3 is a factor of
a number: Add the digits of the number together. If the resulting
sum is evenly divisible by 3, then so was the original number. For
example, to check whether 344 is divisible by 3, add the digits
together: 3 + 4 + 4 = 11. Because the remainder of 11 ÷ 3 is 2 (not 0),
3 does not evenly divide 344. To check whether 357 is divisible by 3,
add the digits together: 3 + 5 + 7 = 15. Because 15 ÷ 3 has remainder 0,
3 divides 357. We can use long division to be sure:
(cid:82) Once you are done with 2 and 3, move on to 5. Check to see whether
the composite number is evenly divisible by 5. Again, there is an easy
check: If the number ends in either 0 or 5, it will be divisible by 5;
otherwise it won’t. Then move on to the next prime number, 7. Con-
tinue down the list until you have checked all of the prime numbers
smaller than the composite number. If you can’t find a prime number
that divides your number evenly, then your number is not a compos-
ite number.
