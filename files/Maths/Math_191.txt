The second special right triangle has the prop-
erty that the hypotenuse is twice as long as the
shorter leg. This second special right triangle
doesn’t have a formal name, but it is often called
a 30° – 60° – 90° triangle, again because of its angle
measurements. A 30° – 60° – 90° triangle is shown
in Figure 10.11.
This triangle also has a specific relationship
between the lengths of the two legs. If we let a
represent the length of the shorter leg, then the
30° – 60° – 90°
hypotenuse has length 2a. This means that c, the Triangle
hypotenuse, equals 2a. Let b represent the length

of the longer leg. We can use the Pythagorean
Theorem to establish the relationship between the length of the longer
leg and the length of the shorter leg:
Example 3
The length of the shorter leg of a 30° – 60° – 90° triangle is 7
centimeters. Find the length of the hypotenuse and the length of
the other leg.
Solution: The length of the hypotenuse is twice the length of the
shorter leg, so the length of the hypotenuse is 14 centimeters.
Using the formula we just derived, the length of the longer leg is:
