For 3 to become a 6 in the denominator, multiply 3 by 2, so multiply
by 1 disguised as  .
For 2 to become a 6 in the denominator, multiply 2 by 3, so multiply
by 1 disguised as  .
When you change the denominator of a fraction, it is important to
keep the value of the fraction the same. The golden rule of changing the
denominator of a fraction is to do to the numerator whatever you do to
the denominator. When you change the numerator and the denominator
by the same factor, you are effectively multiplying by 1.
Now that we have written   and   as fractions with the same de-
nominator we can add them together by simply adding the numerators:
Once we’ve added the two fractions we must check whether or not
we can reduce the resulting fraction. In this case, 5 and 6 are relatively
prime so there is no further reduction.
Example 1
Find:
Solution: In order to add these two fractions we need them to
have a common denominator. First, factor both denominators to
find the greatest common factor: 25 = 5× 5 and 20 = 2× 2 × 5  so
the greatest common factor is 5. Next, find the least common
multiple:
