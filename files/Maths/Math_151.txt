Example 2
Solve the inequality: 2x+ 10 ≥ 7x
Solution: Collect all the terms involving variables on one side,
and the numbers on the other, and then solve for x:
2x+ 10 ≥ 7x
Subtract 2x from both sides 2x+ 10 − 2x≥ 7x− 2x
Simplify 10 ≥ 5x
Divide both sides by 5
Simplify 2 ≥x
Turn the entire inequality around,
if you like seeing the variable on
the left (as I do). x≤ 2
The solution is all real numbers less than or equal to 2.
Example 3
Solve the inequality: 12 > −2x−6
Solution: Add 6 to both sides, and then divide both sides by −2.
Remember to flip the inequality symbol:
12> −2x−6
Add 6 to both sides 12 + 6 > −2x−6+ 6 
Simplify 18 > −2x
Divide both sides by −2 and
flip the inequality 
Simplify −9<x
Turn the entire inequality around,
if you like seeing the variables on
the left (as I do). x> −9
The solution is all real numbers greater than −9.
