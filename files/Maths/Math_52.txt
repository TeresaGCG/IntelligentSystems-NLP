Lesson 3-2: Simplifying Fractions
Two fractions are equivalent if they represent the same number. For
example, the fraction   is equivalent to 4. In other words, when you
divide 3 into 12 you get 4.
Remember: Any whole number can be treated as a fraction with
denominator equal to 1: 4 = 4 ÷ 1 = 4.

Numbers that are a combination of whole numbers and fractions are
calledmixed numbers. Examples of mixed numbers are   and  . Frac-
tions where the numerator is greater than the denominator are called
improper fractions. Examples of improper fractions are   and  . The
term improper fraction is misleading. There is nothing “improper” about
improper fractions; it’s just that some people prefer to see improper frac-
tions written as mixed numbers. If you encounter a teacher who abhors
improper fractions, my advice is to convert improper fractions to mixed
numbers and keep the peace.
The way to convert an improper fraction to a mixed number is to do
the division. The result of the division will be a whole number (the quo-
tient) and a remainder; these two numbers (the quotient and the remain-
der) will appear in the mixed number. The mixed number will be
represented as the quotient plus a fraction with numerator equal to the
remainder and the denominator equal to the divisor.
