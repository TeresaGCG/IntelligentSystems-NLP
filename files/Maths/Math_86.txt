Notice that in adding the two fractions together it was necessary to
get a common denominator. The common denominator used in this situ-
ation was 100, so you had to multiply the fraction   by  . As an inter-
mediate step, the fraction obtained was  :
One of the reasons that base ten is so nice to work with is that it is
easy to write a decimal number with a fixed number of digits as a fraction
that is not necessarily in reduced form. The number of digits to the right
of the decimal point will be the power of 10 that appears in the denomina-
tor of the fraction. Then, the digits in the decimal fraction go into the
numerator. The decimal fraction 0.57 has two digits to the right of the
decimal point, so the denominator is 102 , and 57 goes in the numerator.
The decimal fraction 0.57 is written as the fraction  . The decimal frac-
tion 0.387 has three digits to the right of the decimal point, so the de-
nominator is 103, and 387 goes in the numerator. The decimal fraction
0.387 is written as the fraction  . The number of places past the deci-
mal point is the same as the number of 0s in the denominator. That makes
converting from a decimal fraction to a fraction very easy. The resulting
fraction may need to be reduced.
The reverse process, converting from a fraction to a decimal num-
ber, depends on the denominator of the fraction. If the denominator of
the fraction being converted is a power of 10, the conversion to a decimal
number is as easy as reversing the process we just talked about. The
power of 10 in the denominator tells you how many digits in the numera-
tor need to be to the right of the decimal point. The fraction   has 102
in the denominator, so two of the digits in 523 need to be to the right of
the decimal point, and  = 5.23. This should make sense because you
can see that the numerator is larger than the denominator, and   is an
improper fraction.
