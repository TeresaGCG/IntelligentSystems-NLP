Solution: Start with the equation r ⋅ t = d. We know the distance
(520 miles) and the rate (65 miles per hour) so we can find the
time:
 r ⋅ t= d
Substitute in for the rate and the distance 65 ⋅t= 520
Divide both sides by 65
Simplify  t = 8
It will take her 8 hours to make the trip.
Example 2
The sound of thunder travels about 1 mile in 5 seconds. Suppose
that a bolt of lightning strikes and you hear the thunder after 8
seconds. How far away did the lightning strike?
Solution: The rate that the thunder travels is  , and the
time that it took the thunder to reach your ears is 8 seconds. Use
the equation r ⋅ t = d to solve for the distance:
The lightning struck 1.6 miles away from you.
Example 3
The 2001 Mars Odyssey was launched April 7, 2001, and arrived
October 24, 2001. If the Odyssey traveled a total distance of 286
million miles, how many miles per hour was the spacecraft
traveling?
