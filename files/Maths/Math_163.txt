Linear Functions and Graphs

Example 2
Evaluate the function y = −3x + 5 when x = −1 and write your
answer as an ordered pair.
Solution: When x= −1,y=(−3)(−1)+ 5 = 3 + 5 = 8. This corresponds
to the ordered pair (−1, 8).
Remember that functions are special collections of ordered pairs.
When a function is defined using a formula, we are actually writing an
equation, with the dependent variable on one side of the equality and an
algebraic equation involving the independent variable on the other side.
The ordered pairs that make up the function are generated by evaluating
the algebraic expression for various values of the independent variable.
Each ordered pair that is generated using the equation that defines the
function is called a solution to the equation, or a point that satisfies the
equation.
For a given linear function there are many different values that the
independent variable can take on, and for each value of the independent
variable there is a unique corresponding value for the dependent vari-
able. As a result, a linear equation can have many solutions, and it is
helpful to draw a picture of all of the solutions of a particular equation.
In order to draw such a picture, we need to talk about the Cartesian
coordinate system.
Lesson 9-2 Review
Evaluate the following functions at the indicated value and write your
answer as an ordered pair:
1. ƒ(x) = 5x− 1 at x= −1
2. ƒ(x) = 2x at x = 3
3. ƒ(x) = −4x+ 2 at x= −1
4. ƒ(x) = 6x− 9 at x= 0
Lesson 9-3: The Cartesian Coordinate System
To graph a function you need to be able to graph both the input and
the output at the same time. This amounts to being able to graph an
