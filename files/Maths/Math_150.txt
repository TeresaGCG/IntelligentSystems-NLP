Lesson 8-4: Solving Inequalities in 2 Steps
In general, when you want to solve an inequality involving one vari-
able, the first thing you need to do is move all of the terms that involve
the variable over to one side of the inequality and move all of the terms
that don’t involve the variable over to the other side. If, after combining
all of the terms together, the coefficient in front of the variable is a num-
ber other than 1, you will need to multiply both sides of the inequality by
the reciprocal of the coefficient in front of the variable. Hopefully this
process sounds familiar. It is similar to the method we used to solve
equalities using two steps.
Example 1
Solve the inequality:
Solution: Subtract 4 from both sides, then multiply by 3, and
simplify:
Subtract 4 from both sides
Simplify
Multiply both sides by 3
Simplify x> −36
The solution is all real numbers greater than −36.
