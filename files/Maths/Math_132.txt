percent by multiplying by 100, or moving the decimal point two places to
the right and tacking on a % symbol. The % symbol means “out of 100.”
For example, 90% has a decimal representation 0.90, and 0.6% has a
decimal representation of 0.006.
The more you work with percents, the easier it is to set up these
equations, but if you ever forget how to set up this equation, reach for
your proportions.
Example 1
What is 85% of 560?
Solution: You are given the percent (85%) and the whole (560),
and you need to find the part. Convert 85% to a decimal form (to
get 0.85) and set up the equation with x representing the part:
x= 560 × 0.85 = 476
So, 85% of 560 is 476.
Example 2
What percent of 65 is 52?
Solution: You are given the part (52) and the whole (65), and are
asked for the percent. Let x represent the percent (as a decimal)
and set up an equation:
52= 65 ⋅x
x= 0.8
Convert your decimal to a percent by moving the decimal point
two places to the right and adding a % symbol:
52 is 80% of 65.
