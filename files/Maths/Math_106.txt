Lesson 6-1: Evaluating Expressions
In order to evaluate an expression for particular values of the vari-
ables, replace the variables with their values and do the math. This pro-
cess is often referred to as “plug and chug” because you are plugging in
the numbers and chugging away at the calculation. Make sure that you
pay attention to the order of operations.
Sometimes multiplication symbols are omitted in expressions. For
example, the expression 3x represents the action of taking the variable x
and multiplying it by 3. The multiplication symbol is implied. Remember
that multiplication is shorthand for addition, so 3x actually means x+x+x.
The number 3 in front of the variable is called the coefficient of the vari-
able. This will come in handy when we start manipulating expressions.
Example 1
Evaluate the expression 3x + 5 whenx = 4.
Solution: Everywhere you see an x, write a 4. Then work through
the calculation. When x =4, 3x+5= 3⋅ 4 + 5 = 12 + 5 = 17
Example 2
Evaluate the expression 6x + 10 when x = −2.
Solution: Everywhere you see an x, write a −2. Then work through
the calculation.
When x = −2 ,
6x+ 10 = 6 ⋅ (−2)+ 10 = −12 + 10 = −2
Example 3
Evaluate the expression (2y) ÷ (y + 8) when y = −6 .
Solution: Everywhere you see a y, write a −6. Because y is a negative
number, I will put parentheses around it to keep it with the 6.
Now, work through the calculation.
Wheny = −6,
(2y) ÷ (y+ 8) = (2 ⋅ (−6)) ÷ (−6 + 8) = (−12) ÷ 2 = −6
