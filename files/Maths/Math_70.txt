Example 2
Use the order of operations to evaluate the following expressions:
a. 2 × 62 c. 2 × (−5)2
b. −3× 24 d. −6× (−2)3
Solution:
a. 2 × 62 = 2 × 36= 72
b. −3× 24 = −3× 16 = −48
c. First, find (−5)2:(−5)2= (−5) × (−5) = 25
Then use it to evaluate 2 × (−5)2: 2 × (−5)2= 2 × 25 = 50
d. First, find (−2)3: (−2)3= (−2)(−2)(−2)  = −8
Then use it to evaluate −6× (−2)3:−6× (−2)3= (−6) × (−8) = 48
Again, an exponential expression is written as an and spoken as “a to
the nth power.” It is sometimes read as just “a to the nth” or as “the nth
power of a.” There are some special powers that have specific names.
For example, a2 is read “a squared,” and a3 is read “a cubed.” The reason
for these names stems from their geometrical interpretation, as we will
see in Chapter 10.
Exponents were created to simplify repetitive multiplication. Because
of how they got their start, exponential expressions only make sense if
the exponent is a positive integer. We will have to carefully expand our
interpretation of exponents if we want to work with exponential expres-
sions that involve powers that are either negative integers or zero.
