Example 2
A computer store has a 75% mark-up. If it pays $120 for an all-in-
one printer, find the selling price of the printer.
Solution: Use the equation for the percent mark-up to determine
the mark-up:
Let m represent the mark-up:
Now that we know the mark-up, we can find the selling price, or
the price to the consumer:
The selling price is $210.
When an item goes on sale, the selling price is reduced. The amount
of the price decrease is called the discount, or mark-down. The equation
that models this situation is:
Price = price âˆ’ discount
sale regular
Thepercent discount is the ratio of the discount to the regular price.
It can be calculated using the equation:
discount
Percent discount =
regular price
