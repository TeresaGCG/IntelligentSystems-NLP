Lesson 2-4: Multiplying Integers
In order to multiply two integers, we need to go back to what multipli-
cation represents. The product 3 × 4 is a shorthand way of writing 4 + 4 + 4.
From this we can interpret a product such as 3 × (−5):
3× (−5) = (−5) + (−5) + (−5).
So if we use a number line to figure this out, we would start at −5,
move 5 spaces to the left, and then move 5 more spaces to the left. We
would move a total of 10 spaces to the left and end at −15. So 3 × (−5) = −15.
In this section, I will summarize some of the many patterns involved with
multiplication.
The product of two whole numbers is a whole number. Because whole
numbers are also called positive integers, we can say that the product of
two positive integers is a positive integer. We can expand this idea and
say that the product of two integers with the same sign will be a positive
integer. In other words, 5 × 7 is a positive integer (as we saw in Chapter 1)
and(−5) × (−7) is also a positive integer. This is an important observation
worth writing out again: The product of two negative integers is a posi-
tive integer.
As we saw earlier, 3 × (−5) = (−5) + (−5) + (−5) = −15. This one example
generalizes to the following idea: The product of two integers with oppo-
site signs will be a negative integer.
These steps will walk you through finding the product of two integers:
1. Find the product of their magnitudes, or absolute values.
2. Determine whether the product should be positive or
negative.
(cid:96) If the signs of the two integers involved in the product
are the same, your answer will be a positive integer.
(cid:96) If the signs of the two integers involved in the product
are different, your answer will be a negative integer.
Example 1
Find the product: (−5)(−4)
Solution: Because the signs of the two integers being multiplied
are both negative, the answer will be positive:
(−5)(−4) = 20
