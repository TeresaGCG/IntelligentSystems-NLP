Lesson 5-3: Multiplying Decimal Numbers
Multiplying two decimal numbers is very similar to multiplying whole
numbers. The first step is to ignore the decimal points, and multiply the
numbers together as if they were both whole numbers. To put the deci-
mal point in the right place, count how many digits there are to the right
of the decimal points in both factors. That is how many digits will be to
the right of the decimal point in the resulting product.
