Lesson 10-4 Review
Solve the following problems:
1. A right triangle has legs with length 4 and 6 inches. Find the
perimeter of the triangle.
2. A right triangle has a hypotenuse that is twice as long as one of its
legs. If the other leg is 6 inches long, find the perimeter of the
triangle.
3. Is a triangle with sides of length 4, 7, and 10 centimeters a right
triangle?
Lesson 10-5: Special Right Triangles
There are two right triangles that de-
serve special attention. The first special tri-
angle is an isosceles right triangle. An
isosceles right triangle is a triangle whose
two legs have the same length. It can also
be called a 45° – 45° – 90° triangle, because
Isosceles right triangle
of its angle measurements. A 45° – 45° – 90°
triangle is shown in Figure 10.10.

Example 1
Suppose the length of the hypotenuse of an isosceles right triangle
is 12 inches. Find the length of one of the legs.
Solution: With an isosceles right triangle, both legs have the same
length, so it doesn’t matter which leg length we find. Let a represent
the length of one of the legs. Then the other leg also has length a. We
can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find a:
So the length of each of the legs is   inches.
