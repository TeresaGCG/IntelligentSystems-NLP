Lesson 4-5: Powers of Quotients and Products
Exponential expressions can get even more complicated. Let’s exam-
ine the expression (5a)4. Whenever you need to simplify exponential ex-
pressions, it is always best to start with the meaning of exponents, and
then make use of the properties of multiplication. For example:
Notice that when you raise a product (in this case, the product of 5
and a) to a power, in effect what you need to do is raise each term in-
volved in the product to that power. It doesn’t matter how many terms
are involved in the product, or even if the terms in the products are
themselves exponential expressions. Each term gets raised to that power.
In general, this rule is written as:
(a × b)n = an × bn
Example 1
Expand the following products:
a.
b.
c.
Solution:
a.
b.
c.
