Monomials and Polynomials
211
Thedegree of a polynomial is simply the largest of the degrees of the
monomials that make up the polynomial.
Some polynomials have special names. A polynomial made up of two
monomials is called a binomial. A polynomial made up of three monomi-
als is called a trinomial. The following table gives examples of some of
the more common polynomials that you will encounter in algebra.
Polynomial Leading Degree Common Type of
Coefficient Name Polynomial
4 4 0 Constant Monomial
2x 2 1 Linear Monomial
3x− 9 3 1 Linear Binomial
x2 1 2 Quadratic Monomial
x2+x 1 2 Quadratic Binomial
x2+ 3x− 9 1 2 Quadratic Trinomial
−2x3 −2 3 Cubic Monomial
−5x3+ 3x+ 1 −5 3 Cubic Trinomial
To add or subtract polynomials, you will need to apply the rules for
adding or subtracting monomials. Remember that you can only combine
monomials that involve the same variables raised to the same powers. So,
when you try to add or subtract polynomials, you have to look for mono-
mials that match up and combine them. When you are subtracting one
polynomial from another polynomial, you must distribute the negative
sign throughout the polynomial that is being subtracted.
