Lesson 11-2: Multiplying and Dividing Monomials
Whenever you multiply monomials you must make use of the rules
for exponents discussed in Chapter 4. Some of those rules are worth
mentioning again:
Multiplying and dividing monomials is a bit more relaxed than adding
and subtracting them. The variables that are involved in the monomials
can be raised to different powers. All that matters is that the only opera-
tions involved in the expression are multiplication or division.
When you multiply monomials you must multiply the constants to-
gether and then focus on each variable involved in the product. Use your
rules for how to handle exponents and you canâ€™t go wrong.
