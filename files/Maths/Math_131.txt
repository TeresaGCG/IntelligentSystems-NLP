4. Find 225% of 20.
Lesson 7-4: Percents and Equations
One way to solve percent problems is to set up a proportion. You
may have noticed that once you cross-multiply, you end up with a linear
equation to solve. You can skip the proportion stage and jump right to
the linear equation.
If you start with the proportion:
and cross-multiply, you have the linear equation:
b × c = a × 100
Remember that a is the part, b is the whole, and c is the percent. This
equation translates to:
The whole times the percent is equal to the part times 100
If you divide both sides of the equation by 100 you can simplify the
equation further:
If you associate the 100 with the percent, you can convert the per-
cent, c, to a decimal by moving the decimal point two places to the left.
Remember that dividing a number by a positive power of 10 moves the
decimal point to the left. You can also convert a decimal number to a
