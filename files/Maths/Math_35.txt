Integers
The whole numbers only tell you half of the story. The other half of
the story involves negative numbers. Most of us are all too familiar with
negative numbers. If I have $15 and I want to purchase a pair of shoes
that cost $25, then I’m $10 short. We handle the concept of debt using
negative numbers. Numbers that are greater than 0 are called positive
numbers. The opposite of a positive number is called a negativenumber.
For example, the opposite of 3 is −3, and the opposite of 10 is −10. Oppo-
sites work both ways; the opposite of −3 is 3 and the opposite of −10 is 10.
A number and its opposite always add up to 0; 3 +(−3)= 0 and 10 + (−10) = 0.
The opposite of 0 is 0. It is the only number that is its own opposite—
another special property of 0!
The opposite of a number is also called its additive inverse. The col-
lection of whole numbers and their additive inverses are called the inte-
gers. The counting numbers are called the positive integers and their
opposites are called the negative integers. If a number is greater than 0 it
has a positive sign; a number that is less than 0 has a negative sign.
Integers have two parts: the magnitude of the integer and the sign of
the integer. The magnitude of an integer is the whole number component
of the integer. It tells how big the number is. The sign of the integer
indicates whether the integer is positive or negative. The integer 35 has
magnitude 35 and sign +. The integer −15 has magnitude 15 and sign −.
Most of the time the positive sign is not written and is implied.
Lesson 2-1: The Number Line and Absolute Value
We can graph numbers on a number line. A number line is a graphi-
cal representation of the signs and magnitudes of numbers and their
