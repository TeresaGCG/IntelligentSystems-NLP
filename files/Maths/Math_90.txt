This observation will generalize into a method for adding two deci-
mal numbers together. When you add decimal numbers together, line up
the decimal points and put in any necessary 0s needed as placeholders
after the last digit to the right of the decimal point. This ensures that
both numbers have the same number of digits to the right of the decimal
point. Now you are ready to add, right to left, column by column, carry-
ing over when necessary, as we did with whole numbers in Chapter 1.
Example 3
Find the sum: 12.35 + 1.9
Solution: Line up the decimals and write this sum in column form.
Because the first decimal number has two places to the right of
the decimal point, we need to put a 0 as a placeholder after the 9
in the second decimal number. Now add right to left and carry
over when necessary:
Subtracting decimals proceeds similarly. You need to line up the deci-
mal points and fill in any necessary 0s as placeholders so that both deci-
mal numbers have the same number of digits to the right of the decimal
point. Then follow the rules for subtracting, and borrow when necessary.
