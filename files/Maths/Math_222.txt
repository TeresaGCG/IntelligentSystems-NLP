Solution: In order to find the rate of the spacecraft in miles per
hour we need to know how many hours the Odyssey traveled.
Between April 7th and October 24th, there are 191 days. There
are 24 hours in a day, so the Odyssey traveled 4,584 hours.
If r represents the rate of the Odyssey, we can start with the rate
equation:
r⋅ t=d
Substitute in for the distance and the time
Divide both sides of the equation by 4,584
Simplify
The Odyssey traveled roughly 62,391 miles per hour.
Lesson 12-3 Review
Solve the following problems:
1. Nancy flew 1,040 miles to visit her sister in New York. If her plane
is scheduled to take off at 7 a.m. and will arrive at 10:15 a.m., find
the average speed that the plane will travel in miles per hour.
2. Nancy’s sister lives 32 miles from the airport and would like to
meet her sister at the gate. If Nancy’s flight is scheduled to arrive at
10:15 a.m. and traffic is light enough that her sister can drive 48
miles per hour, what time should she leave for the airport?
3. Harry’s car has a flat tire so he has to ride his bicycle to work. His
office is 2 miles away from his house and he has to get to work by
8 a.m. If he leaves his house at 7:54 a.m. how fast does he have to
ride his bicycle in order to get to work on time? Give his rate in
miles per hour.
Lesson 12-4: Money Problems
Problems that involve money often involve either different coins or
bills. If you work in dollars (when the problems involve bills) or cents (if
the problem involves coins), you will usually end up dealing with whole
numbers instead of fractions or decimals.
