Example 1
Find the perimeter of the triangle
shown in Figure 10.6. 6
3
Solution: The perimeter of the triangle
is 5 + 3 + 6 = 14.

Example 2
Find the perimeter of the rectangle
shown in Figure 10.7.
5
Solution: Opposite sides of a rectangle
have the same length, so the perimeter
10
of the rectangle is 10 + 10 + 5 + 5 = 30. Figure 10.7
Itâ€™s time to show you how algebra can be used to solve problems in
geometry.
Example 3
The length of a rectangle is 7 inches long and the perimeter of the
rectangle is 20 inches. Find the width of the rectangle.
Solution: Let x represent the width of the rectangle that we are
trying to find. Because the perimeter is 20 inches, we know that
7 + 7 + x + x = 20. We can then solve for x:
So, the width of the rectangle is 3 inches long.
