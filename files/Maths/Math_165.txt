The coordinate axes divide the plane into four parts, called quad-
rants. Quadrant I consists of those points that have positive values for
both their x-coordinate and y-coordinate. Quadrant I is located in the
upper right part of the plane. We continue
on to Quadrants II, III, and IV in a
Quadrant Coordinate counter-clockwise progression. Quadrant
 Signs II consists of those points that have a
I (+, +) negative value for their x-coordinate and
a positive value for their y-coordinate.
II (−, +) Quadrant III consists of those points
that have negative values for both their
III (−, −)
x-coordinate and their y-coordinate. Fi-
nally, Quadrant IV consists of those
IV (+, −)
points that have a positive value for their
x-coordinate and a negative value for
their y-coordinate. The signs for the x-coordinates and y-coordinates
are summarized in the table on this page.
