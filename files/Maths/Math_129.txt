Example 1
Convert  into a percent.
Solution: In this case you are given the part (37) and the whole
(40), and you are asked to find the percent. Set up a proportion
and call the percent x:
To solve for x, cross-multiply and apply the techniques discussed
earlier:
So,  represents 92.5%.
Example 2
Find 65% of 360.
Solution: In this case you are given the whole (360) and the percent
(65%), and you are asked to find the part. Set up a proportion
and let x represent the part. Then cross-multiply and solve for x:
So, 65% of 360 is 234.
