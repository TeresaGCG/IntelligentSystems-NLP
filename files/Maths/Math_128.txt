for $9.95. If you plan to read the entire book, which would be

Lesson 7-3: Proportions and Percents
A proportion is an equation involving the ratios of two quantities. A
ratio consists of a numerator and a denominator. In general, the denomi-
nator of a ratio can be any non-zero number. Percents are special ratios
that always have a denominator equal to 100. We consider 100% to be
equivalent to a whole: 100% = 1. We can use a proportion to convert a
ratio into a percent.
A typical percent problem involves a proportion such as  a  =   c  . The
b 100
variable a represents the part, b represents the whole, and c represents
the percent. A percent problem can require you to solve for the part, the
whole, or the percent. The key will always be to set up a proportion. To
solve the proportion, cross-multiply and solve for the unknown piece.
