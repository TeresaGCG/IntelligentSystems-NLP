The accepted order of operations stipulates that multiplication and
division, read left to right, take precedence over addition and subtrac-
tion. In our example 4 + 3 × 2, the multiplication of 3 and 2 must be done
before any addition takes place. If you specifically wanted the addition to
take place first, you would need to use parentheses: (4 + 3) × 2. The order
of operations includes a clause for parentheses: Anything in parentheses
must be done first. The hierarchy of operations is:
1. Parentheses
2. Multiplication and division, read left to right
3. Addition and subtraction, read left to right
Just to make sure that we’re on the same page, let’s work out a
calculation.
Example 1
Evaluate: 2 + 16 ÷ 2 × 10
Solution: Follow the order of operations:
2 + 16 ÷ 2× 10
Divide 16 by 2: 2 + 8 × 10
Multiply 8 by 10: 2 + 80
Add 2 and 80: 82

Evaluate the following:
1. 20 + 3 × (4+ 5)
2. 90 – 4 × 3+ 2
3. (2 + 3) × 5 – 10 × 2
4. 4 ÷ 2 × 9
