The density of a substance is the ratio of the mass of the substance to the
volume that the substance occupies. All of these rates can be described
using fractions as shown in the table on page 121.
Aunit rate is a rate that has a denominator equal to 1. Usually speed,
gas mileage, and density are stated in terms of a unit rate, such as miles
per hour, miles per gallon, and grams per cubic centimeter.
Example 1
While shopping for detergent you notice that the store carries a
10-ounce box for $2.59, an 18-ounce box for $4.39, and a 32-ounce
box for $6.72. Which box of detergent gives you the most detergent
for the least amount of money?
Solution: Because the boxes of detergent have different weights
and different prices, the best thing to do is compare unit rates of
dollars to ounces of detergent. Find the unit rates for all three
sizes.
Size Unit Rate
10 ounces (small)
18 ounces (medium)
32 ounces (large)
Now it is clear that an ounce of detergent costs $0.259 if you buy the
small box, $0.244 if you buy the medium box, and $0.210 if you buy the
large box. You will spend less money per ounce of detergent if you pur-
chase the large box.
Instead of comparing dollars to ounces, you could have compared
ounces to dollars. Then your ratios would have told you how much deter-
gent you would be purchasing for $1. In that case, the best deal would
have been the one that resulted in the largest ratio (the most detergent
for $1), as shown in the following table. It doesnâ€™t matter which way your
