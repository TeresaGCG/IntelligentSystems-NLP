fraction. The numerator of the improper fraction is the result when you
take the product of the whole number and the denominator of the mixed
number and add it to the numerator of the fractional part of the mixed
number. The denominator of the improper fraction will be the same as
the denominator of the fraction in the mixed number.
Example 3
Convert  to an improper fraction.
Solution:
The numerator of the improper fraction will be 4 × 3 + 2 = 14,
and the denominator of the improper fraction will be 3. The
improper fraction is:
You can always check your answer by doing the division again. If you
are able to convert your improper fraction into the original mixed num-
ber, you should have confidence in your answer.
Example 4
Convert  to an improper fraction.
Solution:
The numerator of the improper fraction will be 5 × 11 + 6 = 61,
and the denominator of the improper fraction will be 11. The
improper fraction is:
Converting between one form and another doesn’t really count as a
“simplification.” One way to truly simplify fractions is to pull out fac-
tors that are common to both the numerator and the denominator. In
order to do this, you must completely factor both the numerator and
the denominator and use the properties  and  . A fraction
is reduced if the numerator and the denominator have no common fac-
tors other than 1. Remember from Lesson 1-7 that when two numbers
have no common factors they are called relatively prime.
