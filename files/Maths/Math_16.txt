If the sum of the digits in the ones’ column is greater than 9, you will
need to carry over to the tens’ column. To carry over is to bump up the
number in the place immediately to the left of the column under consid-
eration. Carry-over from the ones’ place will increase the number in the
tens’ place. Carry-over from the tens’ place will bump up the number in
the hundreds’ place, and so on. The next examples will help illustrate this
point.
Example 2
Find the sum:  54 + 29
Solution:When we add the numbers in the ones’ place, we have
4+ 9 = 13; this means we need to carry a 1 over to the tens’ place:
Example 3
Find the sum: 156 + 68
Solution: When we add the numbers in the ones’ place, we have
6+ 8 = 14; this means we need to carry a 1 over to the tens’ place.
We will also need to carry over to the hundreds’ place:
We can add three numbers together as well. To find the sum 2 + 6 + 4,
we could either first find 2 + 6 and then add that result to 4, or we could
find 6 + 4 and then add 2 to that result. Either way we would get an
answer of 12.
Because we can group addition in any way we want, we say that addi-
tion is associative.
