Now that we understand how to measure the distance between two
points that lie on either a vertical or a horizontal line, we can make things
more challenging by finding the distance between two points that lie on
any kind of line. The easiest way to measure the distance between any
two points is to graph them in the Cartesian coordinate system and then
use the Pythagorean Theorem.
Suppose you want to
measure the distance be-
tween the points (0, 0) and
(3, 4). Graph both points
(3, 4)
4 on the Cartesian coordi-
nate system. Notice that
you can create a right tri-
2 4 angle, as shown in Figure
10.12. The key is to find
the coordinates of a third
point that helps to create
a right triangle.

The distance between
our two original points is
–2
the length of the hypot-
enuse of this right triangle.
We can find the length of

each leg by calculating the
vertical or horizontal dis-
tances between one of our original points and this new point. In this case,
the new point is the point (3, 0). Using this new point, we can find the
length of each of the legs.
(cid:96) The horizontal leg is the line segment with endpoints (0, 0)
and (3, 0); it’s length is 3 − 0 = 3.
(cid:96) The vertical leg is the line segment with endpoints (3, 4) and
(3, 0); it’s length is 4 − 0 = 4.
We have created a right triangle with two legs having length 3 and 4,
respectively. We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of
the hypotenuse:
