Exponents

This works because the power rule involves multiplying exponents, and
multiplication is commutative (meaning that the order doesn’t matter).

In general, if n is a positive integer, then a−n=(an)–1=(a–1)n = 1 n

 The role of the negative sign in an exponent is to let you know whether
the base belongs in the numerator or the denominator of the fraction.
Another way to look at it is that the negative exponent just means to take
the reciprocal of the base.
Keep in mind that the reciprocal of a is  , and the reciprocal of   is a.
