So, the length of the hypotenuse is 5. The length of the hypotenuse is
the distance between the points (0, 0) and (3, 4), so the distance between
the points (0, 0) and (3, 4) is 5.
You may be wondering how I knew to use the point (3, 0) to help me
find the distance between (0, 0) and (3, 4). I didnâ€™t just pull it out of thin
air. I just took the first coordinate of one of the points and the second
coordinate of the other point, and put them together to make a new point.
I could have made the point (0, 4), but then the right triangle that I cre-
ated would have been upside down. No one likes to work on triangles that
are upside down.
We can derive a general equation to find the distance between two
points. We will call this equation the distance formula. The distance
formula will enable us to calculate the distance between two points with-
out having to draw a picture and find the (now not-so) mysterious third
point. The distance formula is certainly a shortcut to solving these types
of problems, and it is definitely worth remembering. But some people,
myself included, find it difficult to
memorize formulas. I prefer to under-
(c, d)
stand where the formulas come from.
That way, if I forget the formula I can
always solve the problem by using ge-
ometry and the Pythagorean Theorem.
We will derive a formula to find the
distance between two points (a, b) and
(c, d). First, introduce the point (c, b),
as shown in Figure 10.13. This is the
magical third point that will form a right (a, b) (c, b)
triangle.
Notice that the two points (a,b) and  Figure 10.13
(c, b) lie on a horizontal line, because
the two y-coordinates are the same. Also, the two points (c,d) and (c,b)
lie on a vertical line, because the two x-coordinates are the same. The
