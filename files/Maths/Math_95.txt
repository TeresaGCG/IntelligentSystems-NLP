95
Now do the division, converting this fraction into a decimal
number:
So:
Example 2
Evaluate:
Solution: The decimal number in the denominator has two digits
to the right of the decimal point, so we need to move the decimal
points in both the numerator and the denominator two places to

decimal point, so we will need to introduce a 0 as a placeholder in
the numerator:
Notice that the numerator and denominator are whole numbers
with at least one common factor (both 750 and 125 are evenly
divisible by 5). At this point we could either factor both the
numerator and the denominator and cancel common factors, or
we could do the division. I prefer to factor and cancel:
So:
