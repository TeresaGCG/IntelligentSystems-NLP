Lesson 5-4: Dividing Decimal Numbers
Dividing decimals is very similar to dividing whole numbers. Our first
goal is to turn the decimal number in the denominator into a whole num-
ber. To do this, determine the number of digits there are to the right of
the decimal point in the denominator. Move the decimal points in both
the numerator and the denominator over to the right by that many places,
filling in 0s as a placeholder in the numerator if necessary. For example,
if we wanted to evaluate   we would first observe that the denominator
has two digits to the right of the decimal point. We would then move the
decimal points of both the numerator and the denominator to the right
by two places, and our problem becomes  . This is equivalent to multi-
plying both the numerator and the denominator by 100 (we are multiply-
ing the fraction by the number 1 disguised as the fraction  ). Once we
have a whole number in the denominator we can do the division:
So:
Example 1
Evaluate:
Solution: The decimal number in the denominator has two digits
to the right of the decimal point, so we need to move the decimal
points in both the numerator and the denominator two places to
the right:
