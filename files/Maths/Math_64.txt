Lesson 3-6: Fractions and the Distributive Property
The distributive property still applies when you work with fractions.
For example, the expressions  and  give the same
numerical result. The advantage to using the distributive property is that
you may be able to avoid the process of finding a common denominator
and adding the fractions together, because multiplication of fractions
does not require a common denominator.
Example 1
Use the distributive property to evaluate:
Solution: Use the distributive property and simplify:
Use the distributive property instead of trying to add   and  .
Cancel the common factors in each fraction. Treat each fraction
separately. You are not allowed to cancel across an addition symbol.
Add the two integers together.
8 + 3 = 11
