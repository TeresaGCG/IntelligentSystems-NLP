have the symmetric property, so if you have an inequality such as 3 < x
and you want to turn the inequality around, you must write x > 3 . If you
interchange the sides of an inequality, the inequality symbol must be
turned around so that it “points” to the same expression that it pointed
to originally.
The addition transformations are summarized in the table shown on
page 146.
Example 1
Solve the inequality: x + 3 < 8
Solution: Subtract 3 from both sides and simplify:
The solution is all real numbers less than 5.
Example 2
Solve the inequality: −10 > x − 6
Solution: Add 6 to both sides and simplify:
The solution is all real numbers less than −4.
The transformations involving multiplication and division are summa-
rized in the table shown on page 148: (Pay special attention to the transfor-
mations that involve multiplying or dividing by a negative number.)
