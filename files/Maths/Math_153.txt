Inequalities and Graphs

The starting point of a ray may or may not be included. The relations
< and > are called strict inequalities. For strict inequalities, the starting
point is not included in the ray. We draw an open circle to reflect that the
starting point is not included. The relations ≤ and ≥ are just called in-
equalities, and for these inequalities the starting point is included in the
ray. We draw a closed circle to reflect that the starting point is included.
A ray that does not include its starting point is called an open ray; a ray
that does include its starting point is called a closed ray.
The following will help you draw a ray:
(cid:96) Start with a number line with 0 labeled.
(cid:96) Label your starting point. If your starting point is negative,
make sure you move to the left of 0. If the starting point is
positive, move to the right of 0.
(cid:96) Look at the type of inequality involved to determine if your
ray is open or closed.
(cid:208) If the inequality is strict, then the ray is open; draw
an open circle at your labeled starting point.
(cid:208) If the inequality is not strict, then the ray is closed;
draw a filled-in circle at your labeled starting point.
(cid:96) Draw a ray pointing in the correct direction from your
starting point.
Figure 8.2 shows the open ray representing the set of real numbers
less than 3.

Figure 8.3 shows an open ray representing the set of real numbers
less than −3 and the closed ray representing the set of real numbers less
than or equal to−3. Notice that the only difference between these two rays
