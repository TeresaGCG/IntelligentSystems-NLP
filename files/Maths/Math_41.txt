same as adding the opposite. When subtracting a negative number, it
may help to realize that subtracting a negative is the same as adding. Two
wrongs may not make a right, but two negatives definitely make a posi-
tive. Keep this in mind as we work the next examples.
Example 1
Find  6 − (−2).
Solution: We are subtracting the opposite of 2. As discussed
earlier, the opposite of a negative number is a positive number,
and our problem actually turns into one involving addition:
6− (−2) = 6 + 2 = 8
Example 2
Find−6− (−4).
Solution: We are subtracting the opposite of 4, so our problem
turns into one involving the sum of two integers with opposite
signs:
−6− (−4) = −6+ 4 =−2
Example 3
Find –5 − 3.
Solution: We can write –5 − 3 as –5 + (−3), which is very similar to
one of the problems we worked in the last section:
–5+ (−3) = −8
