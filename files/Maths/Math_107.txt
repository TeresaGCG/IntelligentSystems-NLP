Expressions and Equations
107
When division is involved, writing the expression out using the sym-
bol÷ becomes somewhat awkward. An expression such as (2y) ÷ (y+ 8) will
usually be written in fractional form. Because of the importance of the
order of operations, think of the expression   as   so you are sure
to perform the operations in parentheses before doing the division.
Expressions can involve more than one variable. In order to evaluate
expressions that involve more than one variable you will be given specific
values for all of the variables.
Example 4
Evaluate the expression   when a = 4 and b = 1.
Solution: Everywhere there is an a plug in 4, and where
there’s a b, plug in a 1.
Whena = 4 and b = 1,
Example 5
Evaluate the expression x2 + 5 when x = 4.
Solution: When x = 4,
x2+ 5 = 42+ 5= 16+ 5= 21
Example 6
Evaluate the expression (a + b)(a − b) when a = 5 and b = 2.
Solution: When a = 5 and b = 2,
(a + b) (a − b) = (5 + 2)(5 − 2) = 7 ⋅ 3 = 21
