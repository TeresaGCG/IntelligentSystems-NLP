If, on the other hand, you successfully find a prime number that
divides into the composite number, do the division to find the other fac-
tor that, when multiplied by the prime number you just discovered, gives
your original number. Start to factor this new number. Keep going until
the last factor you are left with is a prime number. This process is called
creating a factor tree. When you are done you will have a list of prime
numbers that multiply to give you your original number.
Example 1
Create a factor tree for 420.
Solution: 420 is even because it ends in 0, so let’s
start by dividing it by 2:
So 420 = 2 × 210.
Now we need to factor 210. Because 210 is
even, it is also evenly divisible by 2:
Now our factor tree is growing:
420= 2 × 210= 2 × 2 × 105.
Now we need to factor 105. It is not even so it
is not divisible by 2. The sum of the digits is
1 + 0 + 5 = 6, which is evenly divisible by 3:
