Example 2
Find the sum: (−4) + (−3)
Solution: Start at −4 and move 3 units to the left, as shown in
Figure 2.4: (−4) + (−3)= −7.
–7 –6 –5 –4

Example 3
Find the sum: (−5) + 3
Solution: Start at −5 and move 3 units to the right, as shown in
Figure 2.5: (−5) + 3 = −2.
–5 –4 –3 –2

When you use a number line to add two integers together, you are
finding a graphical solution to the problem. You can also add integers
algebraically, or without using a number line. Using a number line to
visualize the process helps keep things straight, but if you are working
with large numbers you may need a really, really long number line.
When adding two integers together there are three different possible
scenarios: Both of the integers could be positive, both integers could be
negative, or the integers could have opposite signs. You have already
practiced adding two positive integers together; adding two positive inte-
gers is the same thing as adding two counting numbers. We need to dis-
cuss how to add two negative integers together as well as how to add two
integers that have opposite signs.
One way to add two negative integers is to turn it into a problem of
adding two positive integers and then changing the sign of the answer.
For example, (−4) + (−3) = −7 is the same as −(4 + 3) = −7. So, when you
add two negative integers you can pretend that they are both positive
integers, add them together, and then put a negative sign in front.
