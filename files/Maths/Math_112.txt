Simplify one or 2x−x= 10 − 6 Simplify x= 4 
both sides
Add the same x− 5 = 3 Add 5 to both x− 5 + 5 = 3 + 5
number to each sides and x= 8

Subtract the x+ 7 = 20  Subtract 7 from x+ 7  − 7 = 20 − 7
same number both sides and x= 13

and simplify
Example 1
Solve the equation: x− 5 = 12
Solution: In order to isolate the variable, we need to get rid of the
5. To do this, just add 5 to both sides and simplify:
x− 5 = 12
Add 5 to both sides x− 5 + 5 = 12 + 5 
Simplify x = 17 
The last step is to check our work.
Substitute x = 17 into our original equation and simplify.
Is 17 − 5  equal to 12?
Yes. We can be confident that our answer is correct.
