Example 1
Divide: 348 ÷ 5
Solution: Write the problem as 
Divide the divisor (in this case, 5) into the left digit (or digits) of
the dividend (in this case, 348). To do this, choose the smallest
part of the dividend that the divisor will divide in to. Because 5 is
greater than 3 we need to use the first two digits of our dividend:
34. Look for the largest multiple of 5 that is less than 34. Because
5 × 6= 30 and 5 × 7= 35, the largest multiple of 5 that is less than
34 is 30. Place a 6 (the other factor involved in the product that
gives 30) above the 4 (the last digit of the dividend under
consideration), put 30 underneath the 34 and subtract 30 from 34,
and bring down the 8 from the original 348:
Now do the same thing with the next two digits. Look for the
largest multiple of 5 that is less than 48. Because 5 × 9= 45, that’s
what we need. Write a 9 next to the 6 and 45 underneath the 48,
and subtract:
Because 3 is less than 5 and there are no more digits to the right
to incorporate, we are done. The number 3 in this example is
called the remainder. The remainder is the number “left over”
when we are finished doing the long division. So 348 ÷ 5 is equal
to 69 remainder 3.
