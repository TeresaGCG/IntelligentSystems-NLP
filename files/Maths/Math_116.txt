Lesson 6-6: Solving Linear Equations in 2 Steps
In general, when solving a linear equation involving one variable the
first thing you need to do is move all of the terms that involve the variable
over to one side of the equation, and move all of the terms that don’t
involve the variable over to the other side of the equation. If, after com-
bining all of the terms together, the coefficient in front of the variable is
a number other than 1, you will need to multiply both sides of the equa-
tion by the reciprocal of the coefficient in front of the variable. Once you
have done that, you should have an explicit equation for what numerical
value the variable has to be. The last step is to check your work (using
the original problem statement) to make sure that your answer is cor-
rect. This last step is the one that is most often skipped, but it’s one that
you really should get into the habit of doing. By checking your work you
will know whether your answer is correct or not. If it’s not, you’ll have to
start over.
Example 1
Solve the equation: 
Solution: To isolate the variable, you must move the 5 that appears
on the left side of the equation over to the right side. This can be
done by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation and
simplifying:
