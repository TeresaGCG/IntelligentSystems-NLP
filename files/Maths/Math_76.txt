Lesson 4-3 Review
Evaluate the following exponential expressions:
1. 2 –5 3.
2. (−3)–3 4.
Lesson 4-4: When the Power Is Zero
In order to interpret an exponential expression that has 0 as the ex-
ponent, we must revisit division of exponential expressions. Consider the
ratio , where a ≠ 0. Using one of the properties of multiplication dis-
cussed earlier, any number divided by itself is equal to 1, so:
Using the rules for dividing exponential expressions, when you divide
two numbers with the same base you subtract the exponents, so:
In mathematics, consistency is crucial. There’s not much of a choice
for how to interpret an exponential expression that has 0 as the expo-
nent: a0 = 1. Here is yet another special property of 0: Any number
raised to the power of 0 (other than 0, of course) is 1. For example, 40= 1
and 80= 1.
Using this idea, we can now explore the exponential expression  :
The main idea here is that when you move an exponential expression
from the numerator to the denominator, or vice versa, the net effect is
that the sign of the exponent is changed.
This is demonstrated by   and
