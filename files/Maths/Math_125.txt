Ratios, Proportions, and Percents
125
The other way to solve this proportion is to cross-multiply, and
then solve for the variable.
It may look as if the techniques used in Chapter 6 give the answer
more quickly, but there are advantages to the cross-multiplication tech-
nique, especially when our proportion is not a linear equation, as we will
see in the next example.
Example 2
Solve the proportion:
Solution: This proportion is not a linear equation, because the
variable is in the denominator. The power that the variable is
raised is therefore âˆ’1 (because it is in the denominator; remember
your rules for exponents: To move things from the denominator
into the numerator you must change the sign of the exponent).
Because this is not a linear equation, we will want to cross-multiply.
Once we do that, we will have a linear equation that we can solve
for x.
Cross-multiply 21 = 10x
Interchange the two sides 10x= 21
