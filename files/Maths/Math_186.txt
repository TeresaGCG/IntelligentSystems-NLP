Lesson 10-4: Right Triangles and the Pythagorean
Theorem
A right triangle is a triangle with one angle measuring 90Â°. The right
angle can be marked with a little square to make it stand out (as in Figure
10.1 on page 180). The side opposite the right angle is called the hypot-
enuse, and the other two sides are called the legs. The hypotenuse will
always be longer than either of the two sides.
The Pythagorean Theorem describes the relationship between the
length of the hypotenuse and the lengths of the two legs. The Pythagorean
Theorem states that the sum of the squares of the lengths of the legs of a
right triangle will equal the square of the length of the hypotenuse. This
theorem may be easier to understand if we write it algebraically. Con-
sider the right triangle in Figure 10.8. If a and b represent the lengths of
the legs of the right triangle and if c represents the length of the hypot-
enuse, the Pythagorean Theorem states that:
a2 + b2 = c2
c

a
Pythagorean Theorem
a2 + b2 = c2
