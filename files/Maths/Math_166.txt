Lesson 9-4: Slope and Intercepts
The best way to understand a function is to generate a few ordered
pairs and plot them. Whenever you are trying to examine a function, it is
best to create the ordered pairs in a systematic way. I recommend evalu-
ating the function for a combination of evenly spaced negative and posi-
tive values for x. Evaluating the function when x = 0 is also helpful. I
have evaluated the function ƒ(x) = 2x + 3 for seven values of x, and have
written the corresponding function values and ordered pairs in the table
on page 167.
Notice that all of the values of x are evenly spaced and center around
x = 0. Recall that x is called the independent variable. By “independent”
we mean that we have control over what values we use (within reason, of
course). The function ƒ(x), or the variable y, is called the dependent
variable. By “dependent” we mean that the value of the function depends
on the value of x.
