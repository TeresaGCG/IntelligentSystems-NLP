Example 4
The length of the hypotenuse of a 30° – 60° – 90° triangle is 10
centimeters. Find the length of the two legs.
Solution: The length of the hypotenuse is twice the length of the
shorter leg, so the length of the shorter leg is 5 centimeters. Using
the formula derived earlier, the length of the longer leg is:
Lesson 10-5 Review
Solve the following problems:
1. The length of one leg of an isosceles right triangle is 10 decimeters.
Find the length of the hypotenuse.
2. The length of the hypotenuse of an isosceles right triangle is 16
inches. Find the length of the two legs of the triangle.
3. The hypotenuse of a 30° – 60° – 90° triangle is 24 centimeters. Find
the length of the two legs.
4. The shorter leg of a 30° – 60° – 90° triangle is 30 inches. Find the
lengths of the hypotenuse and the longer leg.
Lesson 10-6: The Distance Formula
If you needed to measure the distance between two points on a number
line, all you have to do is subtract the smaller value from the larger value.
For example, the distance between the points
x= 5 and x= 2 is 5 − 2 = 3.
The distance between the points
x= 7 and x= −3 is 7 – (−3) = 7 + 3 = 10.
The distance between the points
x= −6 and x= −15 is −6− (−15) = −6+ 15 = 9.
Notice that the distance between two points is always a positive number.
We can use the method of calculating the distance between two points
on a number line to calculate the distance between two points on any
