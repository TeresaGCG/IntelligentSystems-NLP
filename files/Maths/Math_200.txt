Solution: In the first triangle, the base has length 10 and the
corresponding height is 5. The enclosed area is:
The base of the second triangle has length 2 and the corresponding
height is 4, so the enclosed area is:

Lesson 10-8: Circles
Acircle is defined to be the set of all points that are an equal distance
from a special point called the center of the circle. The distance between
the center of the circle and a point on the circle is called the radius of the
circle. An example of a circle is shown in Figure 10.17.
Every line that passes through the center of a circle will intersect the
circle at two distinct places. The distance between these two points of
intersection is called the diameter of the circle. The diameter of a circle
is related to the radius of a circle. If d represents the diameter of a circle,
