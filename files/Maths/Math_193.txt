line. We will start by calculating the distance between two points on any
horizontal line. If a line is horizontal, the y-coordinate of every point on
the line is the same; only the x-coordinates can change. To find the
distance between two points on a horizontal line, subtract the smaller
x-coordinate value from the larger x-coordinate value.
Example 1
Find the distance between the points (3, 5) and (10, 5).
Solution: Notice that these two points have the same y-coordinate.
These two points lie on a horizontal line, so the distance between
them is the difference between the two x-coordinates:
10− 3 = 7
We will now turn our attention to finding the distance between two
points that lie on any vertical line. If a line is vertical, the x-coordinate of
every point on the line is the same; only the y-coordinates can change. To
find the distance between two points on a vertical line, all you have to do
is subtract the smaller y-coordinate value from the larger y-coordinate
value.
Example 2
Find the distance between the points (3, 5) and (3, 8).
Solution: Notice that these two points have the same x-coordinate.
These two points lie on a vertical line, so the distance between
them is just the difference between the two y-coordinates:
8− 5 = 3
Because the distance between two points must always be a positive
number, we need to make sure that we always subtract the smaller num-
ber from the larger number. If we are dealing with general points that are
represented using variables, we can’t tell which of the two variables rep-
resents a larger number. Fortunately, we have a way of making sure that
a number is always positive: Use the absolute value! So if we want to
make sure that an algebraic expression is always positive we can just put
absolute value symbols around it!
