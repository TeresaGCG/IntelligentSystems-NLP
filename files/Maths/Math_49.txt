Operations With Fractions
Real numbers belong to one of two camps. A real number can either
be written as a ratio of two integers, or it can’t. A number that can be
written as a ratio of two integers is called a rational number. A number
that cannot be written as a ratio of two integers is called an irrational
number. In this chapter we will focus on rational numbers. Irrational
numbers will be discussed briefly in Chapter 4.
A rational number is often called a fraction, though the definition of a
fraction isn’t as precise as that of a rational number. Some people use the
wordfraction to describe the ratio of two numbers that may, or may not be,
integers. I will use the word fraction to mean a rational number. A fraction
is written  , and it means the same thing as a ÷ b. In the fraction  , the
number a is called the numerator of the fraction and the number b is
called the denominator of the fraction. Remember that when you look at
a fraction as a division problem, the number a is called the dividend and
the number b is called the divisor. In other words, numerators and divi-
dends represent the same thing, as do denominators and divisors. It is also
important to remember that integers, as in the number 3 or the number 7,
can be thought of as fractions. In the same way that the sign is implied with
a positive number, the denominator of 1 is implied with integers.
One of the most interesting fractions is the number 1. It has many
forms: It can be written as   This is an important property of 1
that we will use repeatedly. In general, any non-zero number divided by
itself is 1, so we can represent 1 as the ratio of any non-zero number to
itself. In other words, if a represents any non-zero number, then  .
