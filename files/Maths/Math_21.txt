Numbers
21
one-digit number, and add the two results together. There’s just one twist:
When you work out the second product you must shift your numbers to
the left by putting a 0 in the ones’ place. This is because the second
number is in the tens’ place; you’ve already taken care of the ones’ place
with the first product. This method will become clearer once I discuss
the distributive property.
Example 3
Find the product: 32 × 43
Solution:
Work out the Then, focus on the 4 Now add the two
problem 32 × 3 in 43 and multiply products together:
(ones): 32 × 4(tens).
Remember to put a 0
in the ones’ place in
the product:
So 32 × 43= 1,376.
Example 4
Find the product: 68 × 23
Solution: Break the problem up into two products: 68 × 3 (ones)
and 68 × 2 (tens) add the results:
So 68 × 23= 1,564.
