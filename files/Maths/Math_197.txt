Example 3
Find the distance between the points (2, 7) and (14, 2).
Solution: Use the distance formula. It doesn’t matter which point
you use first:
Lesson 10-6 Review
Find the distance between the following pairs of points:
1. (3, 5) and (1,−2)
2. (4, 1) and (2, 3)
3. (6, 3) and (8,−1)
4. (−2, 4) and (1,−2)
Lesson 10-7: Area
The amount of space that a closed polygon encloses is the area of the
polygon. Area is measured in “square units.” In other words, the square
is the basic unit for measuring area. Recall that a square is a quadrilateral
that has four right angles and all four sides have the same length. The
area of a square is defined to be the square of the length of one of its
sides. A square with side length 1 inch has area 1 square inch, or 1 inch2.
A square with side length 2 centimeters has an area of 4 square centime-
ters, or 4 centimeters2.
