Solution: Let w represent the kWh used, and let B represent the
monthly bill. We have the following equation:
B= 10+ 0.04w
We need to evaluate this equation when w = 1,500:
B= 10+ 0.04w
= 10+ 0.04 ⋅ 1,500
= 10+ 60
= 70
Robert’s electric bill will be $70.
Example 4
Cameron spent   of his money on video games. He has $30 left.
How much did he have to start with?
Solution: Let m represent the money Cameron spent on video
games, and let S represent the money he started with. The money
he started with is split up into two groups: the money he has left
and the money he spent on games. He spent   of the money he
started with on games. We can write the following equation:
We can now solve for S:
Subtract  from both sides
Simplify
Multiply both sides by 3
Simplify
Cameron started out with $90.
