Lesson 3-3: Dividing Fractions
As you go through life you will find that there are plenty of opportu-
nities to divide one integer by another integer. For example, suppose you
and 3 friends order a pizza. You agreed to divide the pie evenly. Suppose
that the pizza is cut into 8 slices. In order to determine how many pieces
you each are allowed to eat, you would need to divide 8 by 4; each of you
would be able to eat 2 slices.
There are also times when you will need to divide one fraction by
another fraction. Suppose you have a recipe for cookies that calls for   of
a cup of butter. If you have 3 cups of butter, you may want to calculate
how many batches of cookies you can make without going to the gro-
cery store. To figure this out you would take 3 cups and divide it by  .
Now that you see why you would want to divide one fraction by another
fraction, we can talk about how to divide one fraction by another fraction.
