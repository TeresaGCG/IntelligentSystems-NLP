relationships to each other. You create a number line by first drawing a
line and putting a mark for 0, as shown in Figure 2.1. By convention, the
positive integers are located to the right of 0; the negative integers are
located to the left of 0. The numbers increase in value as you go from left
to right, regardless of whether you are working with negative or positive
numbers. In general terms using variables, if a number x is located to the
right of another number y on the number line, then x is greater than y.
From a different perspective, if a number y is located to the left of an-
other number x on the number line, then y is less than x.

To place numbers on a number line you have to know two things. The
first thing you need to know is whether the number goes to the left or the
right of 0. This is determined by the sign of the number; if a number is
positive it goes to the right, and if it is negative it goes to the left. The
second thing you need to know is how far away from 0 to put the number.
That is determined by the magnitude of the number. The magnitude of
the integer tells you how many units the integer is away from 0.
Example 1
Graph the numbers 2, −3, and 5 on a number line. Order the
numbers from smallest to greatest.
Solution:
The numbers from smallest to greatest are −3, 2, 5. Their graph is
shown in Figure 2.2.

The distance from a number to 0 is called its absolute value. The
absolute value of a number is always positive. A number and its opposite
are always the same distance away from 0, but are located on opposite
