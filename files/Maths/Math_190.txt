Example 2
The length of one leg of an isosceles right triangle is 1.5 feet. Find
the length of the hypotenuse of this triangle.
Solution: The lengths of each of the legs is 1.5 feet. Let c represent
the length of the hypotenuse. Use the Pythagorean Theorem to
find c:
The length of the hypotenuse is approximately 2.12 feet.
In general, there is a special relationship between the lengths of the
legs and the length of the hypotenuse in 45° – 45° – 90° triangles. If a
represents the length of each of the legs and c represents the length of
the hypotenuse, we see that:
This relationship between the length of the hypotenuse and the length
of each leg holds for all isosceles right triangles. This relationship is worth
noticing, understanding and becoming familiar with, but it is not neces-
sarily worth memorizing. It is just one application of the Pythagorean
Theorem.
