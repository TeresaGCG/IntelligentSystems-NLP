113
Example 2
Solve the equation: x+ 8 = −5
Solution: Subtract 8 from both sides and simplify:
x+ 8 = −5
Subtract 8 from both sides x+ 8 − 8 = −5 − 8 
Simplify x = −13
Let’s check our work.
Substitute x = −13  into the original equation.
Is−13+ 8 equal to −5? Yes.
Transforming equations using addition and subtraction is just the
beginning. We can also transform equations using multiplication and di-
vision. You will need to transform equations using multiplication and
division whenever the coefficient in front of the variable is any number
other than 1. Remember that the goal is to get the variable by itself so
that the equation explicitly states what the variable is equal to.
