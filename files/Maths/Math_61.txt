So 100 is the common denominator. Change each fraction so that
its denominator is 100:
Finally, add the two fractions together:
Check to see if any reduction is possible. Because 57 and 100 are
relatively prime, no further reduction is possible, and the problem
is solved.

Lesson 3-5: Subtracting Fractions
Subtracting fractions is very similar to adding fractions. The denomi-
nators of the two fractions must be the same in order to be subtracted.
Remember that, like integers, fractions can be positive or negative. When
you practiced adding and subtracting integers you had to pay attention to
the signs of the integers involved. Subtracting a negative integer was
equivalent to adding the corresponding positive integer, since two nega-
tives make a positive. You must pay attention to the signs of the two
fractions involved in the subtraction, and subtracting a negative fraction
will be equivalent to adding a positive fraction.
