If two sides of a triangle are
the same length, the triangle
is called an isosceles tri-
angle. If all three sides of a
triangle  have  the  same
Acute Right length, the triangle is called
an equilateral triangle. Fig-
ure 10.2 illustrates examples
of scalene, isosceles, and
equilateral triangles.
Moving up in the realm
of polygons are the four-
Obtuse Equiangular sided polygons, or quadrilat-
erals. Quadrilaterals can be
Figure 10.1 classified by the relationships
between their sides. Opposite
sides of a quadrilateral are
parallel if, upon extending
the two sides into lines, the
two lines never intersect. If
one pair of opposite sides of
a quadrilateral are parallel,
the quadrilateral is called a
trapezoid. If both pairs of
opposite sides of a quadri-
Scalene Isosceles Equilateral
lateral are parallel, the
quadrilateral is called a par-

allelogram. Every parallelo-
gram has the property that
the sides opposite each
other have the same length.
If, in addition to opposite
sides being the same length,

gram have the same length,
the parallelogram is called

a rhombus. Figure 10.3
shows examples of these
quadrilaterals.
