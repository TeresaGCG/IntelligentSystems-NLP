Many mathematicians have constructed proofs of the Pythagorean
Theorem. Even non-mathematicians have discovered new ways to prove
this theorem. In fact, President Garfield published a proof of the
Pythagorean Theorem back in 1876.
One of the nice things about the Pythagorean Theorem is that it works
both ways:
(cid:96) Given any right triangle, the lengths of the three sides satisfy
the relationship a2 + b2 = c2.
(cid:96) If the lengths of the three sides of a triangle satisfy the equation
a2+ b2 = c2, where a and b are the lengths of the shorter sides
and c is the length of the longest side, then the triangle is a
right triangle.
The Pythagorean Theorem involves squaring lengths and solving for
lengths by taking the square root of a number. Remember that if a num-
ber is a perfect square, its square root will be an integer. Otherwise, its
square root will be an irrational number. We can use a calculator to
approximate the square root of a number that is not a perfect square and
round to get estimates for these irrational numbers.
Example 1
If the lengths of the two legs of a right triangle are 5 inches and 12
inches, find the length of the hypotenuse.
Solution: Let c represent the length of the hypotenuse and use
the Pythagorean Theorem to find c:
So, the length of the hypotenuse is 13 inches.
Example 2
A right triangle has one leg that is three times longer than the
other leg. If the length of the hypotenuse is 10 inches, find the
lengths of the two legs.
