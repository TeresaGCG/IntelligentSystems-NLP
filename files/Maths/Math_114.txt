You can also look at the division transformation in terms of multipli-
cation. If you start with the equation 3x = 15, you can multiply both sides
of the equation by the reciprocal of the coefficient in front of the variable.
In this case, the coefficient in front of the variable is 3, and its reciprocal
is . So, in order to solve the equation 3x = 15 we could multiply both
sides of this equation by  :
This perspective is helpful when the coefficient in front of the vari-
able is not an integer.
Example 3
Solve the equation: 
Solution: You may have gotten used to seeing the variable on the
left rather than on the right. Don’t let that bother you; switch
them around using the transformation that lets you interchange
the sides of the equation if it makes you feel better. Then multiply
both sides of the equation by −4 (the reciprocal of  ) and
simplify:
Interchange the sides of the equation
Multiply both sides of the equation by –4
Simplify:  x= −80
The last step is to check our work.
Is  equal to 20? Yes, it is.
