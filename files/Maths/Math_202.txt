The results of calculations of the circumference of a circle are usu-
ally written as multiples of π, but I’ll also give numerical approximations
for the answers. Numerical approximations are usually more meaningful.
Example 1
Find the diameter and the circumference of a circle with radius
7 inches.
Solution: The diameter of a circle is twice the radius; the diameter
of our circle is 14 inches. The circumference of a circle is 2π r; the
circumference of our circle is 14 π inches.
This is roughly 43.98 inches.
The area of a circle is also related to its radius. The area of a circle
can be calculated using this formula:
Area = π r2
The results of calculations of the area of a circle are usually written
as multiples of π, but I’ll also give numerical approximations for the an-
swers. Numerical approximations are usually more meaningful.
Example 2
Find the area of a circle with radius 4 centimeters.
Solution: Use the equation for the area of a circle:
Area = π (4)2 = 16π cm2
This is roughly 50.27 cm2.
Example 3
Find the area of a circle with a diameter of 10 feet.
Solution: In order to use our equation for area, we must know the
radius of the circle. We were given the diameter of the circle, so
we must use that information to find the radius. Then we can use
our equation for the area of a circle:
