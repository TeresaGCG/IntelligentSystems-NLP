Example 6
Compare:  and 
Solution: We could find the lowest common denominator and
then compare numerators. I’d like to illustrate the second ap-
proach here, just for a change.
First, convert each fraction to a decimal number:
So:  and 
Now compare the decimal representations. Both numbers have a
3 in the tenth’s place, so they tie.
 has a 5 in the hundredth’s place and
 has a 6 in the hundredth’s place, so   wins.
Therefore
We can also compare a fraction and a decimal number. For this com-
parison you can either convert the fraction to a decimal number and then
compare the two decimal numbers, or you can convert the decimal num-
ber to a fraction, and then compare the two fractions. You will get the
same result regardless of the method you choose.
