You don’t usually talk about a negative percent decrease. That is
similar to using two negatives in a sentence. Technically, two negatives
make a positive, but sometimes two negatives is just confusing. So choose
your terminology appropriately: Either the percent decrease is a positive
20% (with the word decrease indicating the direction of the change) or
the percent change is –20%.
Example 3
The population of Mishicot, Wisconsin, has grown from 2,000 to
2,200. Find the percent change and the percent increase in the
population.
Solution: The first step in finding the percent increase is to find
the percent change. The percent change is found by first evaluating
the ratio 
Next, find the decimal equivalent of   and then convert it to a
percent by moving the decimal point two places to the right:
The percent change in the population is 10%, and the percent
increase in the population is 10%.
Example 4
The weight of the space shuttle before launch is 2,041,166 kilograms.
At the end of the mission, the space shuttle weighs 104,326
kilograms. Find the percent change and the percent decrease of
the weight of the space shuttle.
