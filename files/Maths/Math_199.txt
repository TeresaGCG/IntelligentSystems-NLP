Solution: The first polygon is a square with side length 12. The
area of the square is 144 unit2. The second polygon is a rectangle
with length 4 and width 7. The area of the rectangle is 28 unit2.
The third polygon is a right triangle with legs of length 9 and 4.
The area of the right triangle is:
In the previous example I was able to find the area of a right triangle.
Unfortunately, not every triangle is right. Before I can discuss the area of
a run-of-the-mill triangle I must define some terms. The base of a tri-
angle is just one of the sides of the triangle singled out. Any side of a
triangle can serve as the base. Once you specify the base of a triangle,
there will be one vertex of the triangle that does not come in contact with
the base. The distance from that vertex to the base is called the corre-
sponding height of the triangle. There is no official height of a triangle.
The height of a triangle depends on the side that serves as the base.
Now that we know about the base and the corresponding height of a
triangle, we can find the area of a triangle. The area of a triangle is one-
half the product of the length of the base and the corresponding height of
the triangle. If b represents the length of the base and h represents the
corresponding height of the triangle, the area enclosed by the triangle is
given by this formula:
