The midpoint of a line segment is the unique point that is exactly
halfway between the two endpoints of the segment. I recommend asso-
ciating the midpoint of a line segment with the average of the coordi-
nates of the two points. The midpoint of the line segment with endpoints
(a, b) and (c, d) is the point whose x-coordinate is the average of the
x-coordinates of the two endpoints and whose y-coordinate is the aver-
age of the y-coordinates of the two endpoints. If M is the midpoint of the
line segment with endpoints (a,b) and (c,d), you can use this formula to
find the midpoint M:
( )
a + c b + d
M = ,

Example 1
Find the midpoint of the line segment with endpoints (3, 8) and
(−2, 6).
Solution: Using the formula for the midpoint we have:
It may be helpful to see a picture of the relationship between these
three points. Figure 10.5 shows these three points on the Cartesian coor-
dinate system.
