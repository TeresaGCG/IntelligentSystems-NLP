To compare two decimal numbers, start by comparing their integral
parts. If the two decimal numbers have the same integral part, start com-
paring their fractional parts. To compare the fractional parts, start com-
paring the digits immediately to the right of the decimal point and keep
going right until one number wins.
Example 1
Compare: 10.56 and 8.37
Solution: Compare the integral parts of the two numbers: The
integral part of 10.56 is 10, and the integral part of 8.37 is 8. Clearly
10.56 wins:
10.56> 8.37
Example 2
Compare: 1.369 and 1.375
Solution: Both numbers have the same integral part, so they tie,
and we will need to compare the fractional parts. Start with the
tenths’ place: Both numbers have a 3 in the tenths’ place, so they
still tie. 1.369 has a 6 in the hundredths’ place and 1.375 has a 7 in
the hundredths’ place, so 1.375 wins:
1.369< 1.375
Example 3
Compare: 1.25 and 1.254
Solution: Both numbers have the same integral part, so they tie,
and we will need to compare the fractional parts. Start with the
tenths’ place: Both numbers have a 2 in the tenths’ place, so they
still tie. Both numbers have a 5 in the hundredths’ place, so they
continue to tie. Now compare the digits in the thousandths’ place:
1.25 has a 0 in the thousandths’ place and 1.254 has a 4 in the
thousandths’ place, so 1.254 wins:
1.25< 1.254
