Integers
45
Next, determine whether your answer should be positive or
negative. Because the signs of both integers involved in the
problem are different, the answer should be negative:
52÷(−4) = −13
Lesson 2-5 Review
Find the following quotients:
1. −36÷ 3 3. 27 ÷(−9)
2. −90÷(−5) 4. −64÷(−16)
Lesson 2-6: Integers and the Distributive Property
The nature of the distributive property doesn’t change with the intro-
duction of negative integers. It just takes a little practice adjusting to the
variety of problems that arise with this new twist. Remember the dis-
tributive property:
If a, b, and c are numbers,
then a × (b + c) = a × b + a × c
To evaluate a × (b + c) you will need to evaluate a × b and a × c
separately and then add them.
Example 1
Evaluate the following:
a. (−7) × (5+ 3)
b. (−4) × (6− 2)
c. (−3) × (−2− 8)
d. (2) × (3 − 8)
Solution:
a. (−7) × (5+ 3)= (−7)(5) + (−7)(3) = −35 + (−21)
= −56
