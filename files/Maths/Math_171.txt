substitutex= 0 into the equation, you will get y=m⋅ 0 +b= b. That is why
b is called the y-intercept. The y-intercept of the line y = mx + b is the
point (0, b).
Example 5
Find the slope and the y-intercept of the function ƒ(x) = 3x + 5.
Solution: The slope is 3 and the y-intercept is the ordered pair
(0, 5).
Example 6
Find the slope and the y-intercept of the function ƒ(x) = 2x − 3.
Solution: The slope is 2 and the y-intercept is the ordered pair
(0,−3).
Lines also have an x-intercept. The x-intercept of a function is the
point where the line crosses the x-axis. At that point, the value of y is 0.
Finding the x-intercept of a function involves setting the function equal
to 0 and solving the resulting linear equation for x.
Example 7
Find the x-intercept of the function y = 2x − 3.
Solution: Set y = 0 and solve for x:
y= 2x− 3
Sety= 0 0 = 2x− 3
Add 3 to both sides 0  + 3 = 2x− 3 + 3
Simplify 3 = 2x
Interchange the two sides of the equation 2x= 3
Divide both sides by 2
Simplify
The x-intercept is
