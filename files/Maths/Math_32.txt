In order to evaluate an expression that involves both multiplication
and addition you need to use the order of operations. Consider the prob-
lem 7 × (5+ 3). Using the order of operations, we would add 5 and 3 first
because of the parentheses (to get 8) and then multiply 7 and 8 together
to get 56. I would get the same result if I added the products 7 × 5 and
7 × 3 together: 35 + 21 = 56. This isn’t just a coincidence. It will always
happen.
The distributive property allows us to evaluate expressions such as
7 × (5 + 3) in more than one way. The distributive property is stated in
general terms using variables. If a, b, and c are any numbers, the dis-
tributive property states that:
a × (b + c) = a × b + a × c
We say that multiplication distributes over addition. The distributive
property can be used to make calculations easier, as we will see in the
examples. Sometimes it is easier to find the sum of two products using
the distributive property than it is to find one product directly.
Example 1
Use the distributive property to calculate 25 × 104.
Solution:
25 × 104 = 25 × (100+ 4)
= 25 × 100+ 25 × 4
= 2,500 + 100
= 2,600
Example 2
Use the distributive property to calculate 4 × 508
Solution:
4 × 508 = 4 × (500+ 8)
= 4 × 500+ 4 × 8
= 2,000 + 32
= 2,032
