Our tree is getting longer:
420
420= 2 × 210
= 2 × 2 × 105
2 210
= 2 × 2 × 3 × 35.
Now we need to factor 35:
2 105
5 × 7 = 35 and both 5 and 7 are
primes so we are done:
3 35
420= 2 × 210
= 2 × 2 × 105
5 7
= 2 × 2 × 3 × 35
= 2 × 2 × 3 × 5 × 7. Figure 1.1
The factor tree can be visualized as a tree with branches as shown
in Figure 1.1.
You will be surprised at how useful factoring will be.
If two numbers have no common factor other than 1, they are said to
be relatively prime. For example, 15 and 8 are relatively prime, because
the factors of 15 are 3, 5, and 15, and the factors of 8 are 2, 4, and 8.
Notice that both 15 and 8 are composite numbers, yet they are relatively
prime. The numbers 7 and 21 are not relatively prime, because 7 is a
factor of both 7 and 21. So even though 7 is a prime number, it is not
relatively prime to 21.
If two numbers are relatively prime, then their greatest common fac-
tor is 1. If two numbers are not relatively prime, then their greatest com-
mon factor is the largest number that evenly divides both numbers. The
easiest way to find the greatest common factor is to factor each number
into their prime factors. Then match up, prime by prime, the prime num-
bers that appear in both factorizations. If any prime numbers repeat, you
must take that into consideration.  For example, the greatest common fac-
tor of 12 and 15 is 3, because 12 = 2 × 2 × 3 and 15 = 3 × 5; 3 is the largest
number that evenly divides 12 and 15. The greatest common factor of 20
and 36 is 4: 20 = 2 × 2 × 5 and 36 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 3. Both 20 and 36 have a
repeating factor of 2, which is why their greatest common factor is 4.
Now that you understand the idea of the greatest common factor of
two numbers, it is time to talk about the least common multiple of two
