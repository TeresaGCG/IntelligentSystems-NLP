The distributive property can be used to understand the process of
multiplying two two-digit numbers. For example, to find the product of
36 × 15 apply the distributive property:
36× 15= 36 × (10 + 5)
= 36 × 10+ 36 × 5
= 360 + 180
= 540
Now look at the method for multiplying two two-digit numbers dis-
cussed previously. Notice that the intermediate products are exactly the
same in both methods. The two procedures actually use the same method;
the only difference is in how the work is organized.
