We calculated the same slope in Example 1 and in Example 2. In
fact, one of the things that make lines so special is that their slope is
constant. It doesn’t matter which set of points you use to calculate the
slope of a line.
Notice that the slope of the linear function ƒ(x) = 2x + 3 is 2; 2 also
happens to be the coefficient in front of x. Could this be a coincidence?
No! You can easily recognize the slope of any linear function. For example,
the slope of the linear function ƒ(x) = −3x − 9 is –3!
Example 3
Pick two points and calculate the slope of the function
ƒ(x) = −2x+ 1.
Solution: We can see from the formula for ƒ(x) that the slope is
−2. It doesn’t matter which two points I pick, so I will pick points
corresponding to x= 0 and x= 1. The point corresponding to x= 0
is (0, 1) [because ƒ(0) = 1], and the point corresponding to x= 1 is
(1, −1) [because ƒ(1) = (−2) ⋅ 1 + 1 = −1]. The slope of the line
passing through (0, 1) and (1, −1) is:
Example 4
Find the slope of the line that passes through the points (4, −2)
and(6, 3).
Solution: Use the equation for the slope:
I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter that there are two important
constants involved in a linear function ƒ(x) = mx + b. The constant m is
the slope, which we have just talked about. The other constant, b, is
called the y-intercept.
The y-intercept of a function is the point where the line crosses the
y-axis. At that point the value of x is 0. This point is determined by finding
the value of y when you plug x into the function. If y = mx + b and you
