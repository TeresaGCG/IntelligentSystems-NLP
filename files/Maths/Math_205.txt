Monomials and Polynomials
Your experiences with functions have exposed you to some math-
ematical expressions that are very important in algebra. For example, the
function ƒ(x) = 4x is the function that takes whatever is in parentheses
and multiplies it by 4. The expression 4x is an example of a monomial. A
monomial is an expression that involves only numbers and variables that
have powers that are positive integers.
A monomial in one variable is an expression of the form
k ⋅ xn where k is a real number and n is a positive integer.
The degree of a monomial with only one variable is the power that
the variable is raised to. A constant can be viewed as a monomial of the
form k ⋅ x0 (remember from our rules for exponents that any non-zero
number raised to the power of 0 is 1), so a constant is a monomial of
degree 0.
A monomial with two variables is an expression of the form
k⋅xn⋅ym
The number k is called the coefficient of the monomial. The degree
of a monomial with more than one variable is the sum of the powers of
all of the variables that appear. A monomial of the form k ⋅ xn⋅ ym has
degree n +m.
Lesson 11-1: Adding and Subtracting Monomials
The only way that you can effectively add or subtract two monomials
is if both of the monomials involved have the exact same variables raised
