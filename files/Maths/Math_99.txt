Decimals
99
Estimating quotients is similar to estimating products. Round the
numerator and the denominator and then do the division. The place you
round to depends on the numbers you are working with and how accu-
rate you want to be.
Example 4
Estimate the quotient: 
Solution: Round the numerator to the nearest ten: 32.5 ≈ 30
Round the denominator to the nearest one: 5.28 ≈ 5
So:
Lesson 5-5 Review
Round to the nearest one and estimate the following:
1. 23.65 + 19.75 + 22.56
2. 55.67 − 23.94
3. 14.89 × 5.22
4. 5.26 × 3.05
5.
Lesson 5-6: Comparing Decimals and Fractions
Comparing two integers involves determining which of the two num-
bers is larger than the other. One way to compare two integers is to place
them carefully on the number line. The number that is furthest to the
right is the larger of the two numbers. On the other hand, the number
that is furthest to the left is the smaller of the two numbers. Now, we need
a method for comparing fractions or decimal numbers.
