2. What percent of 75 is 60?
3. 72 is 60% of what number?
Lesson 7-5: Percent Change
The change in a variable is the difference between the final value of
the variable and the initial value of the variable. For example, the price of
a gallon of gasoline last week was $2.85, and this week the price is $2.52.
The change of the price of a gallon of gasoline is 2.52 – 2.85, or –$0.33.
When the change of a variable is negative, it means that the variable has
decreased in value. When the change of a variable is positive, it means
that the variable has increased in value. We use the symbol ∆ to repre-
sent the change of a variable:
∆x=x −x

The percent change of a variable is the ratio of the change in the
variable divided by the initial value of the variable. This answer must be
written as a percent, so you will need to convert the fraction to a percent.
If the variable increases, then we talk about the percent increase of the
variable. If the variable decreases, we talk about the percent decrease.
Both the percent increase and the percent decrease are positive num-
bers. The sign of the percent change is included through the words in-
crease and decrease.
Example 1
Find the percent increase from 40 to 45.
Solution: The percent change is found by first evaluating the ratio
final – initial
