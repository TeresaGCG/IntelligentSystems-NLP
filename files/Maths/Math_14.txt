In the number 10, the symbol 1 is located in the tens’ place, and the
symbol 0 is located in the ones’ place. As we continue to count, we in-
crease the number located in the ones’ place until we reach 19. The next
number is written 20. The number in the tens’ place is increased by 1 and
we start over with 0 in the ones’ place. Our numbers can increase by
changing the value in the ones’ place. These same 10 symbols are re-
cycled in this pattern to describe numbers through 99. At this point, we
need another place. One hundred is represented by the number 100: The
symbol 1 is located in the hundreds’ place, and there are 0s in the tens’
place and the ones’ place. We continue with this pattern until we get to
999. The cycle continues and the thousands’ place is introduced. As the
dots signify, this is how the list of counting numbers can go on forever.
Lesson 1-1: Symbols Used
Symbol Meaning Example
+ Addition 7 + 2 = 9
− Subtraction 7 – 2 = 5
×, ·,  or ( )( )  Multiplication 4 × 2= 8
4 ⋅ 2= 8
(4)(2) = 8
/, −,  or ÷ Divided by
= Is equal to 4 = 4
≠ Is not equal to 4 ≠ 2
> Is greater than 4 > 2
≥ Is greater than or equal to 4 ≥ 4, 4 ≥ 2
< Is less than 2 < 4
≤ Is less than or equal to 4 ≤ 4, 2 ≤ 4
