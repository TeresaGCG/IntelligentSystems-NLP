very important. For example, if the base is −4 and the exponent is 6, you
would write this number as (−4)6. The parentheses make it absolutely
clear that the base is negative. If you leave off the parentheses and write
−46 what you are actually writing is the number −(4)6 . In other words, −46
is the negative of 46, and 46 is the number with base 4 and exponent 6.
There is a difference between (−4)6 and −46. It’s worth expanding both
expressions just to make the point:
(−4)6= (−4)(−4)(−4)(−4)(−4)(−4) = 4,096
−46=–(4)6= −(4× 4 × 4 × 4 × 4 × 4) = −4,096
Notice that the magnitude of these two numbers is the same, but they
have opposite signs. We can determine whether an exponential expres-
sion will be positive or negative by trying to observe a pattern. Let’s
expand powers of −1:
(−1)1= −1
(−1)2= (−1)(−1) = 1
(−1)3= [(−1)(−1)](−1) = 1× (−1)= −1
(−1)4= [(−1)(−1)][(−1)(−1)] = 1× 1 = 1
(−1)5= [(−1)(−1)][(−1)(−1)](−1) = 1× 1× (−1) = −1
When the exponent is even, the answer is positive, and when the expo-
nent is odd the answer is negative. This pattern always holds:
(cid:96) When you multiply an even number of negative numbers
together, the result will be a positive number.
(cid:96) When you multiply an odd number of negative numbers
together, the result will be a negative number.
The easiest way to determine whether a particular product of num-
bers is positive or negative is to count the number of negative numbers
involved in the product, or look at the exponents of the negative numbers
involved in the product. Because (−4)6 involves a negative number being
raised to an even power, we would expect the result to be a positive num-
ber, which it is.
