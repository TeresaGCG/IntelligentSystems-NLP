Homework Helpers: Basic Math and Pre-Algebra
22
When you multiply 3 numbers together, the order in which you per-
form the multiplication doesn’t matter. For example, when finding the
product 4 × 2 × 5, it doesn’t matter if you first find 4 × 2 and then multiply
the result by 5: (4 × 2) × 5 = 8 × 5 = 40 or if you first find 2 × 5 and then
multiply the result by 4: 4 × (2 × 5) = 4 × 10 = 40. Multiplication is said to
be associative (again, just as addition is). It doesn’t matter how you group
a string of products together, or which products you find first.
Lesson 1-4 Review
Find the following products:
1. 4 × 9
2. 36 × 8
3. 62 × 18
4. 3 × 5 × 8
5. 16 × 10,000
Lesson 1-5: Properties of 0 and 1
You are now ready to learn some of the properties of zero that make
it unique. The symbol zero represents that there is “nothing,” but it is
very important to know where we have nothing. You use 0 as a place-
holder in a number such as 1,052. If you didn’t have a zero in the hun-
dreds place, the number would be 152. You have just seen examples of
how zero is used as a placeholder in multiplication. The thousands’, hun-
dreds’, tens’, and ones’ places are a way to organize our numbers so that
we can perform calculations more easily. Without 0, this system could
not work.
In addition to being a placeholder, the “nothingness” of 0 is also spe-
cial because it can be added to any number and not change the original
number. For example, 6 + 0 = 6 and 152 + 0 = 152. Zero is called the
additive identity because when you add it to any number you don’t change
that number. In our number system there is only one additive identity; 0
is unique in that regard.
Zero does some strange things when it is involved in multiplication.
Instead of doing “nothing” to the original number, it turns all numbers
into itself. If you take any number and multiply it by 0, you will get 0.
