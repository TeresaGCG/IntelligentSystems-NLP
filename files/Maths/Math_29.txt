numbers. The least common multiple of two numbers is the smallest
number that they both divide into evenly. The easiest way to find the
least common multiple is to create a factor tree for both numbers and
find the greatest common factor. Then multiply the original two numbers
together and divide by the greatest common factor. This result is the
least common multiple of the two numbers.
Example 2
Find the least common multiple of 12 and 15.
Solution: As discussed above, the greatest common factor of 12
and 15 is 3. The least common multiple of 12 and 15 is found by
evaluating (12 × 15) ÷ 3: (12 × 15) ÷ 3 = 180 ÷ 3 = 60. So the
smallest number that both 12 and 15 divide evenly into is 60.
Lesson 1-7 Review
1. Create factor trees for the following numbers:
a. 96
b. 215
c. 310
2. Find the greatest common factor and the least common multiple of
15 and 35.
Lesson 1-8: Order of Operations
We have four basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication,
and division. If several numbers are involved in any combination of these
operations, we need to know which operation to perform first. For ex-
ample, if we want to evaluate 4 + 3 × 2, we need to decide whether we will
add 4 and 3 together first and then multiply by 2, or multiply 3 and 2
together first and then add 4. You may want to do it one way and I may
want to do it the other way. We would both get different answers and
then argue about who was right. In order to avoid the confusion, an order
of operations was established. Using the accepted order of operations,
everyone will get the same answer when working out calculations that
involve more than one operation.
