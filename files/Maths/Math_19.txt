reduced from 5 to 4. Looking ahead to the subtraction in the
tens’ place, we will have 4 – 6. Because 4 is less than 6, we will also
need to borrow a 100 from the hundreds’ place:

Lesson 1-4: Multiplication
Multiplication is a shortcut for addition. The expression 4 × 5 can
be interpreted as either 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 or 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4. In other words,
4 × 5 can be thought of as adding four fives or as adding five fours. Being
familiar with the multiplication table (or times table) for the first 10 whole
numbers will be very helpful in almost every math class you take.
There are three popular symbols used to represent multiplication:
×, ⋅, and ( )( ). The expressions 4 × 5, 4 ⋅ 5, and (4)(5) all mean the same
thing. The numbers that are being multiplied together are called factors,
and the result is called the product. With multiplication the order doesn’t
matter; evaluating 4 × 5 gives the same result as evaluating 5 × 4. We say
that multiplication is commutative (just as addition is).
Multiplying by 10, 100, 1,000, etc. is probably the nicest multiplica-
tion of all. Notice that 6 × 10 = 60, 6 × 100 = 600, and 6 × 1,000 = 6,000.
There is a pattern worth noting: When multiplying a number by 10 you
