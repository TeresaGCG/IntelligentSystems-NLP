the signs of the two integers involved in the problem. Just as with multi-
plication, if the two signs are the same, the answer will be positive. If the
two signs are different, the answer will be negative. It doesn’t matter
which number (the dividend or the divisor) is negative; as long as the
dividend and the divisor have opposite signs, the answer will be negative.
Example 1
Find the quotient: (−30) ÷ (−5)
Solution: First, find the magnitude of the answer: 30 ÷ 5 = 6. Next,
determine whether your answer should be positive or negative.
Because the signs of both integers involved in the problem are
the same (they are both negative), the answer should be positive:
(−30)÷(−5)= 6
Example 2
Find the quotient: (−42)÷ 6
Solution: First, find the magnitude of the answer: 42 ÷ 6 = 7. Next,
determine whether your answer should be positive or negative.
Because the signs of both integers involved in the problem are
different, the answer should be negative:
(−42)÷ 6 = −7
Example 3
Find the quotient: 52 ÷(−4)
Solution: First, find the magnitude of the answer:
