4. On her cross-country trip to Wisconsin, Betty drove 980 miles in 14
hours. Find her speed as a unit rate.
Lesson 7-2: Proportions
In the last chapter, we solved linear equations. Remember that a lin-
earequation is an equation created by setting two linear expressions equal
to each other. In the last section we talked about a different kind of
algebraic expression: a ratio. When two ratios are set equal to each other,
we have an equation that is called a proportion. A proportion is an equal-
ity between two ratios:
Proportions can be simplified by multiplying both sides of the equal-
ity by the product of the denominators and simplifying using the proper-
ties of multiplication:
This process is often described as “cross-multiplying” and can be
visualized as:
The products ad and cb are called cross-products of the proportion.
If a proportion involves a variable, you can cross-multiply and then
solve for the variable as we did in the last chapter.
Example 1
Solve the proportion:
Solution: There are two ways to solve this proportion. The first
way involves noticing that this proportion also happens to be a
linear equation. As such, we can solve this equation by using the
techniques discussed in Chapter 6. Multiply both sides of the
equation by 16 and reduce the resulting fraction.
