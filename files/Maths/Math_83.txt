Decimals
We use a very clever system to write whole numbers: the base ten
system. There are other number systems, such as the Roman numeral
system, which is great for keeping track of the number of Super Bowls
that have been played. However, there is a reason that the Roman nu-
meral system is not widely used today. Try multiplying XXIX and XIV
together using only Roman numerals. The Roman numeral system works
well for counting, but not well for adding or multiplying.
In the base ten system we have ten symbols at our disposal: 0, 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. The number 2,365 represents 2 thousands, 3 hundreds,
6 tens, and 5 ones. The order that the numbers appear matters. As you
move to the left, the power of ten increases by 1: the ones’ place can be
thought of as 100, the tens’ place is 101, the hundreds’ place is 102, and so
on. We can represent any whole number using this system.
Base ten is great, but you should realize that 10 is not the only base
that can be used to represent numbers. There are other popular systems
in use today, such as base two, base eight, and base sixteen, but that is a
topic for another day. Right now, it is just important to understand that
everything we have been talking about so far involves the base ten num-
ber system.
Lesson 5-1: The Decimal System
The base ten system works well for representing integers, but it doesn’t
work as well for other types of numbers, such as irrational numbers and
many fractions. Fractions and irrational numbers have an integral part,
which is an integer, and a fractional part, or a part whose magnitude is
