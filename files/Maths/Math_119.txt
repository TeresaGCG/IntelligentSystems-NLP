5x= 2x+ 6
Subtract 2x from both sides 5x− 2x = 2x+ 6 − 2x
Simplify 3x= 6
Multiply both sides of the equation by 
Simplify x= 2
Finally, we’ll check our answer:
Ifx= 2, then the left-hand side of the equation gives 5x= 5× 2 = 10
and the right-hand side gives 2x+ 6 = 2 × 2 + 6 = 4+ 6= 10 . Both
sides calculate to 10, so our answer is correct.
There are potential problems that you have to look out for when you
are working with an equation that has more than one term involving the
variable. One of the potential problems is that a solution to the equation
may not exist. For example, the equation x = x + 1 has no solution, be-
cause there is no number that is equal to itself plus 1 (not even 0 can do
that!). If you subtract x from both sides of the equation and simplify,
you get:
Because this last equation is absurd, so is our original equation. Ab-
surd equations have no solution.
