Solution: The area of a right triangle is one-half the product of
the lengths of the two legs. We know that the hypotenuse is 6
centimeters, so the length of the shorter side is 3 centimeters,
and the length of the longer leg is   centimeters.
This is roughly 7.79 cm2.
Example 3
Scott charges $2.10 per square foot to tile a room. How much will
I have to pay Scott to tile my 12-foot-by-10-foot rectangular dining
room?
Solution: The area of the rectangular dining room is 12 Ã— 10, or
120 ft2. Let x represent the amount that Scott will charge to tile
the dining room. Scott charges 2.10 per ft2, so we can set up a
proportion:
We can cross-multiply and solve for x:
Scott will charge $252 to tile the dining room.
