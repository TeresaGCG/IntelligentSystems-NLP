The area of a square is the motivation for calling the exponential
expressiona2, “a squared.” The area of a square of length a is “asquared,”
or a2.
We use abbreviations for units of length. The most common units for
length are inches, centimeters, and feet. Their abbreviations are “in,”
“cm,” and “ft,” respectively. These abbreviations for units of length will
help us abbreviate units of area. A square inch is abbreviated in2, a square
centimeter is abbreviated cm2, and a square foot is abbreviated ft2.
Armed with a new ruler (the square unit, as in square inches) we can
measure the area of other polygons besides a square. We will start with a
rectangle and get more complicated. The area of a rectangle is the prod-
uct of its length and its width. For example, a rectangle with length 4
inches and width 6 inches would enclose an area of 24 in2. A rectangle
with length 10 feet and width 6 feet would enclose an area of 60 ft2.
The area of a right triangle can be
related to the area of a rectangle. You
can think of a right triangle as one-half
b of a rectangle, as shown in Figure 10.14.
Notice that the width and length of
the rectangle correspond to the two legs
a
of the right triangle. The area of the rect-
 Figure 10.14 angle is then the product of the lengths
of the two legs of the triangle. Because
two triangles make up one rectangle, it follows that the area of one tri-
angle is one-half of the area of the rectangle. That gives us a formula for
the area of a right triangle.
