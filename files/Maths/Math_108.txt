Lesson 6-1 Review
Evaluate the following expressions when x = 5 and y = −3.
1. 3x+ 2 4. (x + 2y)(x − y)
2. 4x+ 2y 5.
3. x2+ 2y 6.
Lesson 6-2: Equations
An equation is a statement that says that two expressions are equal.
The expressions that make up an equation are separated by the symbol
“=,” which is called an equal sign. Usually equations will contain vari-
ables, but they don’t have to.
You have already seen several examples of equations in this book.
The statements 23 = 2 ⋅ 2 ⋅ 2 and am ⋅ an = am+n are two examples of
equations that you may recall reading in Chapter 4. The first equation
does not contain any variables, and the second equation contains three
variables: a, n, and m.
Equations can have numbers and variables on both sides. Equations
can be simple or they can be complicated. The important thing about an
equation is that whatever expression appears on the left-hand side of the
equal sign is equivalent to whatever expression appears on the right-hand
side. The two expressions may not look alike, but they must represent
the same thing.
When you are given an equation with only one variable, your job
will be to “solve the equation.” To solve an equation, you will need to
determine the numerical value or values of the variable that make the
equation true. This process involves moving all of the numbers to one
side of the equation and all of the terms involving variables to the other
side. When moving around the terms in an equation, you must follow
some rules.
