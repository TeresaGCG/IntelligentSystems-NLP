Algebra and Geometry
Algebra and geometry go hand in hand, thanks in part to Rene
Descartes. Algebra provides a systematic way to approach computational
problems in geometry. Before get into the algebra of geometry, we have
to discuss some basic geometric shapes. Our focus will be on the most
interesting and common geometric shapes: polygons.
Lesson 10-1: Polygons
A polygon is a closed plane figure with at least three sides. The sides
meet only at their endpoints. The point where two sides meet is called a
vertex. The name of a polygon is determined by the number of sides that
it has. A triangle is a polygon with three sides. A quadrilateral is a poly-
gon with four sides. There are many different kinds of quadrilaterals.
Squares, rectangles, parallelograms, and trapezoids are just a few types
of quadrilaterals.
The smallest number of sides that a polygon can have is three. A
three-sided polygon is called a triangle. Triangles can be classified by
theirangle measures. A triangle whose interior angles are all less than 90째
is called an acute triangle. A triangle that has one angle that is equal to
90째 is called a right triangle. A triangle that has one angle that is greater
than 90째 is called an obtuse triangle. A triangle whose angles all have the
same measure is called an equiangular triangle. One important feature
about triangles is that the sum of the interior angles is 180째. Figure 10.1 on
page 180 shows examples of acute, right, obtuse, and equiangular triangles.
Triangles can also be classified by the lengths of their sides. If all
three sides of the triangle have different lengths, the triangle is scalene.
