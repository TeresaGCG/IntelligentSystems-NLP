Exponents
73
For example, let’s examine 
Using our order of operations, we have to work out what is in paren-
theses first, then deal with the exponent:
Notice that the exponent of the final result is 12, which happens to be
the product of the two powers involved in the exponential expression: 3
and 4. This generalizes into a power rule for exponents: When you raise
an exponential expression to a power, you multiply the exponents, or
when you raise a power to a power you multiply the powers. We can write
this mathematically as:
( )
am n= am××××× n
