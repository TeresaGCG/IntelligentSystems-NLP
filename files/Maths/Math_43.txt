Example 2
Find the product: (−6)(5)
Solution: Because the signs of the two integers being multiplied
are not the same, the answer will be negative:
(−6)(5) = −30
To find the product of three integers, use the fact that multiplication
is associative and break the problem up into finding two products.
Example 3
Find the product: (−5)(2)(−3)
Solution:
Use the associative property of multiplication: [(−5)(2)](−3)
Evaluate (−5)(2). A negative times a positive
will be negative: (−10)(−3)
Find the product (−10)(−3). A negative times
a negative will be positive: 30
Lesson 2-4 Review
Find the following products:
1. 3 × (−6) 3. 8 × (−4)
2. −4× (−3) 4. (−10) × 4 × (−3)
Lesson 2-5: Dividing Integers
When dividing one integer by another integer it is best to divide the
problem up into two parts: determining the sign of the answer and deter-
mining the magnitude of the answer. To determine the magnitude of the
answer, pretend that both numbers involved in the division problem are
positive and do the division. To determine the sign of the answer, look at
