Solution: Let a represent the length of the shorter leg. Then the
length of the other leg is 3a. Use the Pythagorean Theorem to
find a:
So the length of the shorter leg is   inches, and the
length of the longer leg is three times that, or  . I used
a calculator to approximate   and  , which are irrational
numbers, and then rounded the answer.
Example 3
Sarah wants to measure the size of
an angle to see if it is a right angle.
She creates a triangle around it as
shown in Figure 10.9. Is Sarah’s angle 28
21
a right angle?
Solution:  Check  to  see  if  the
Pythagorean Theorem is satisfied.
First calculate the sum of the squares 20
of the lengths of the two shorter sides: Figure 10.9
202+ 212= 400 + 441 = 841
Compare that result to the square of the length of the longer side:
282= 784
Because the two results are not equal, the Pythagorean Theorem
does not hold, so the triangle Sarah created is not a right triangle.
Therefore, Sarah’s angle is not a right angle.
