Example 4
One cubic centimeter of gold has a mass of 19.3 grams. A gold
bar held in the Federal Reserve Bank is 727.9 cubic centimeters.
Find the mass of a gold bar.
Solution: Let x represent the mass of a gold bar. Then 1 cubic
centimeter is to 19.3 grams as 727.9 cubic centimeters is to x. Use
this information to set up a proportion:
Now cross-multiply and solve for x:
So, one gold bar has a mass of 14,048.47 grams.
Example 5
One pound corresponds to a mass of 454 grams. How much does
a gold bar weigh?
Solution: Let x represent the weight of a gold bar. Set up a
proportion for this problem. One pound is to 454 grams as x pounds
is to 14,048.47 grams:
Cross-multiply and solve for x:
