Lesson 8-4 Review
Solve the following inequalities:
1.
2. 3 < −4x− 8
3. 3x> 5x− 8
Lesson 8-5: Graphing Inequalities Using the Number Line
The solutions to the inequalities in the last section were represented
algebraically. The answer was not unique; there were many real numbers
that satisfied the inequalities. We described the collection of these solu-
tions with words, but a picture is worth a thousand words. It helps to
understand the solution to an inequality by being able to visualize it. To
do this, we will make use of the number line.
Zero is one of the most important points on a number line. The point
0 is called the origin. Negative numbers lie to the left of the origin, posi-
tive numbers lie to the right. To draw a number line, draw a line with
arrows pointing in both directions, and label a point 0. It’s best to keep
your number lines simple. Some people start labeling lots of integers
around 0, but I recommend only labeling points that are pertinent. And
at this point, the only important point is 0. Take a look at my number line
shown in Figure 8.1.

A ray looks as if it’s a line that is cut in half. A ray has only one arrow;
the other arrow has been cut off. It has a definite starting point, but it
never ends. Any number on the number line can serve as a starting point
for a ray. A ray either includes all of the numbers to the left of (or less
than) the starting point or all of the numbers to the right of (or greater
than) the starting point. The set of all numbers less than a given number
is drawn as an arrow starting at the given number and pointing to the left.
The set of all numbers greater than a given number is drawn as an arrow
starting at the given number and pointing to the right.
