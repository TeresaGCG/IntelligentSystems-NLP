Divide both sides by 10 
Simplify. Because the denominator is 10,
writing the answer as a
decimal number is natural. x= 2.1
Example 3
At the local print shop, 25 copies cost $1.50. At this rate, how
much would 60 copies cost?
Solution: Set up a proportion. Let x represent that cost of 60
copies. Then 60 is to x as 25 is to $1.50. This can be translated into
a proportion:
Now it is a matter of cross-multiplying and solving for x:
Money is always given as a decimal. In order to get a decimal
representation for this answer we will need to divide:
So, 60 copies will cost $3.60.
