2. Find the slope, y-intercept, and x-intercept of the function
ƒ(x) = −3x − 6.
3. Find the slope of the line that passes through the points (−2, 1) and
(4,−4).
Lesson 9-5: Graphing Linear Equations
Now that we understand the idea of the slope and the intercepts of a
line, it’s time to get a picture of what our lines look like. The key to
graphing linear functions, or lines, is that all you need is two points and a
straightedge (or ruler).
In order to find two points on the line, pick two different values for x,
plug them into the equation and find the corresponding values for y. Plot
the two ordered pairs and connect the dots with a ruler. That’s all there is
to it. You can use any two points that you want.
Another way to graph a line is to find both intercepts and plot them.
The way to find the x-intercept is to set y = 0 and solve for x; to find the
y-intercept set x = 0 and solve for y. I’ll use the intercept method in my
examples, so that we can review how to find them as well as how to solve
equations. The more you practice, the better you’ll get. You don’t have
