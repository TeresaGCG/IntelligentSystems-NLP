Numbers
15
Just as language has other symbols besides letters (there are periods,
semicolons, and question marks), math uses other symbols besides num-
bers. These symbols tell you what to do with the numbers. The four most
common operations are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and divi-
sion. Although there is just one symbol for addition and one symbol for
subtraction, there are several symbols for multiplication and division. In
addition to manipulating numbers, you can also compare them. To do
that, you need to know the symbols for “less than” and “greater than.”
The chart on page 14 lists the main symbols that we will use here, and
gives some examples of how they are used.
Lesson 1-2: Addition
To get started, we should begin by reviewing the principles of addi-
tion. The symbol for addition is +, and the numbers to be added are
called addends. The result of the addition is called the sum. The symbol
for what the sum is equal to is the equal sign, =. With addition, the order
doesn’t matter. The sum 3+8 and the sum 8+3 are the same. Because
the order that we add things doesn’t matter, we say that addition is
commutative.
Sometimes addition is written horizontally: 6 + 3 = 9. Other times
addition is written vertically. When written vertically, the horizontal line
represents the equal sign. The vertical representation is particularly use-
ful when you are adding two numbers with two or more digits. It helps
keep track of the places for the ones, tens, hundreds, etc. by writing the
two numbers in a column format with those places aligned:
Example 1
Find the sum: 23 + 25
