Lesson 12-4 Review
Solve the following problems:
1. Erich spends   of his weekly salary on food and   of his weekly
salary on rent. If, after paying his rent and buying his food for the
week he has $110 of his weekly paycheck left over, how much does
Erich earn each week?
2. The Port Orange Press pays its sales force a base salary plus
commission. The base salary is $200 per week and 10% commission
on all sales in excess of $1,000. What will an employee earn if his or
her sales level is $2,500 for one week?
Lesson 12-5: Spatial Problems
Spatial problems combine concepts in geometry with algebraic
problem-solving skills to answer questions. Being familiar with equa-
tions to find the perimeter, circumference, and area of special shapes
such as triangles, rectangles, squares, and circles will come in handy.
Example 1
One leg of an isosceles right triangle is 15 inches long. Find the
perimeter of the triangle.
Solution: In order to find the perimeter of the triangle we must
find the lengths of all three sides. We already know the lengths of
two of the three sides (the two legs), so we need to find the length
of the hypotenuse. Let c represent the length of the hypotenuse.
Then, as we discussed in Chapter 10,   inches.
The perimeter of the triangle is  , or
roughly 51.21 inches.
Example 2
The length of the hypotenuse of a 30° − 60° − 90° triangle is 6
centimeters. Find the area of the triangle.
