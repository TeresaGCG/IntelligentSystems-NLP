Inequalities and Graphs
Solving equations involves working with equalities. We have some
guidelines for how to transform equations so that the solution can be
determined easily. These transformations are possible because equality is
an equivalence relation. Remember that an equivalence relation is a rela-
tion that has the reflexive, symmetric, and transitive properties. It’s time
to introduce you to two new relations: less than and greater than. We call
these two relations inequalities.
Lesson 8-1: Inequalities
An inequality is an algebraic statement that compares two algebraic
expressions that are not necessarily equal. I mentioned four basic in-
equalities in Chapter 1 and I’ll summarize them here:
Symbol Meaning Example
< Is less than 5 < 8
≤ Is less than or equal to 5 ≤ 8, 5 ≤ 5
> Is greater than 8 > 5
≥ Is greater than or equal to 8 ≥ 5, 5 ≥ 5
