point and which point you use as the initial point when calculating the
changes. If (a,b) is the final point when calculating ∆y, it also must be the
final point when calculating ∆x. Let’s use a couple of different points in the
table to calculate the slope of the line ƒ(x) = 2x + 3:
Point Number x ƒ(x) = 2x+ 3
1 −3 −3
2 −2 −1
3 −1 1
4 0 3
5 1 5
6 2 7
7 3 9
Example 1
Calculate the slope of ƒ(x) = 2x + 3 using points #1 and #3.
Solution: Point #1 is the point (−3, −3) and point #3 is the point
(−1, 1). The slope is:
Example 2
Calculate the slope of ƒ(x) = 2x + 3 using points #4 and #7.
Solution: Point #4 is the point (0, 3) and point #7 is the point
(3, 9). The slope is:
