Example 4
The length of a rectangle is three times its width. If the perimeter
of the rectangle is 64 centimeters, find the dimensions of the
rectangle.
Solution: Let x represent the width of the rectangle, which is the
shorter of the two sides. The length of the rectangle will be 3x,
because we were told that the length is three times its width. The
perimeter of the rectangle will be 3x+ 3x+x+x= 64. We can then
solve for x:
So, the width of the rectangle is 8 centimeters long, and the length
of the rectangle is 24 centimeters long. We can write the dimensions
of a rectangle as either the length by the width or the width by the
length. We usually write the smaller of the two first. We would
write that this rectangle is 8 centimeters by 24 centimeters.
There is a very important property that applies to the perimeter of
every triangle. It is called the triangle inequality. The triangle inequality
states that if you add up the lengths of any two sides of a triangle, your
answer will always be greater than the length of the third side. The tri-
angle inequality can be used to determine whether a particular triangle
can exist or not. For example, it is not possible to have a triangle with
side lengths of 3, 5, and 10 because, if you add the two shorter side lengths
together you will get 8, and 8 < 10. Because a triangle with side lengths of
3, 5, and 10 violates the triangle inequality, such a triangle cannot exist.
You donâ€™t have to take my word for it. Try to make a triangle with these
side lengths.
