Problems involving multiplying by a power of 10 are the easiest mul-
tiplication problems to solve. The effect of multiplying a decimal number
by a power of 10 is that only the decimal point moves.
First, let’s consider positive powers of 10: numbers such as 10, 100, or
1,000. In this case, the problem becomes one of moving the decimal point
to the right by one, two, or three places, depending on the power of 10
being multiplied. For example:
If you run out of 0s you can always put some in, as long as it is to the
right of the decimal point.
Negative powers of 10, such as 10–1, 10–2, and 10–3, are easy to repre-
sent as decimal numbers. For example:
Multiplying a decimal number by a negative power of 10, such as 0.1,
0.01, or 0.001, involves moving the decimal point to the left by the magni-
tude of the power of 10. For example:
