Example 4
Find the sum: (−5) + (−6)
Solution: (−5) + (−6) = −(5 + 6) = −11
When you add two integers that have opposite signs, find the differ-
ence between their absolute values. Then, think about the sign of your
answer. If the integer with the larger absolute value is negative, your an-
swer will be negative. If the integer with the larger absolute value is posi-
tive, then your answer will be positive. The integer with the larger absolute
value determines whether the answer will be positive or negative.
Example 5
Find the sum: 18 + (−6)
Solution: Find the difference between their absolute values:
18− 6= 12
The integer with the larger absolute value is 18, so the answer will
be positive.
18+ (−6) = 12
Notice that 18 + (−6) can be thought of as 18 − 6. Adding integers with
opposite signs and finding the difference between the magnitudes of the
two integers gives the same result. You can think of subtraction as add-
ing two integers that have opposite signs.
Example 6
Find the sum: (−12) + 5
Solution: Find the difference between their absolute values:
12− 5= 7
The integer with the larger absolute value is −12, so our answer
should be negative:
(−12) + 5 = −7
